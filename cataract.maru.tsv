38239417	Straatsma Syndrome and cataract: case report and review of the literature.	Straatsma Syndrome is known as unilateral myopia, amblyopia, and myelinated retinal nerve fibers (MRNF). The syndrome can be associated with other findings such as nystagmus, strabismus, and optic nerve hypoplasia among others. However, no cases associated with cataract have been reported. The visual prognosis depends on the myelinated retinal nerve fibers extension, the early amblyopia therapy, and the coexistence of other signs. We present the case of a 4-year-old girl with Straatsma Syndrome and cataract in the left eye. Despite the cataract surgical treatment with the refractive error correction and the amblyopia therapy, no visual improvement has been reported. <b>Abbreviations:</b> MRNF = Myelinated retinal nerve fibers, LE = Left eye, PD = Prism dioptres, BCVA = Best-corrected visual acuity, RE = Right eye, HM = Hand movement, CF = Counting fingers.
38068917	Novel <i>CRYGC</i> Mutation in Conserved Ultraviolet-Protective Tryptophan (p.Trp131Arg) Is Linked to Autosomal Dominant Congenital Cataract.	Congenital cataract (CC), the most prevalent cause of childhood blindness and amblyopia, necessitates prompt and precise genetic diagnosis. The objective of this study is to identify the underlying genetic cause in a Swiss patient with isolated CC. Whole exome sequencing (WES) and copy number variation (CNV) analysis were conducted for variant identification in a patient born with a total binocular CC without a family history of CC. Sanger Sequencing was used to confirm the variant and segregation analysis was used to screen the non-affected parents. The first de novo missense mutation at c.391T>C was identified in exon 3 of <i>CRYGC</i> on chromosome 2 causing the substitution of a highly conserved Tryptophan to an Arginine located at p.Trp131Arg. Previous studies exhibit significant changes in the tertiary structure of the crystallin family in the following variant locus, making <i>CRYGC</i> prone to aggregation aggravated by photodamage resulting in cataract. The variant can be classified as pathogenic according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria (PP3 + PM1 + PM2 + PS2; scoring 10 points). The identification of this novel variant expands the existing knowledge on the range of variants found in the <i>CRYGC</i> gene and contributes to a better comprehension of cataract heterogeneity.
37904374	Self-limited corneal ectasia in a post-LASIK eye after cataract surgery: A case report.	INTRODUCTION: To present a case with a history of laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) developing central conic protrusion after phacoemulsification cataract surgery, which spontaneously resolved 5 months postoperatively. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 55-year-old female who underwent myopic LASIK surgery 10 years ago presented to the clinic with bilateral cataracts and without ectasia. Following phacoemulsification cataract surgery and intraocular lens implantation in the right eye, the patient experienced a significant increase in spherical equivalent and corneal astigmatism. DIAGNOSES: Based on a central conic protrusion on topography examination, surgically-induced corneal ectasia was diagnosed. INTERVENTIONS: Topical lubricants, corticosteroids, and serial follow-up with corneal topography. OUTCOMES: The corneal protrusion gradually resolved over a period of 5 months. LESSONS: For post-LASIK patient who developed corneal protrusion following uneventful cataract surgery with a clear corneal incision, the clear corneal wound may have disrupted the biomechanical stability of the post-LASIK eye, compromising the peripheral stromal integrity. Additionally, postoperative inflammation could have contributed to corneal ectasia. Smaller clear corneal wounds or scleral tunnel entry during cataract surgery in post-LASIK eyes should be considered. Monitoring wound healing and using topical steroids can aid in achieving satisfactory outcomes and reducing the potential vision-threatening complications associated with corneal ectasia.
37353733	Case report of the evidence of a spontaneous Reverse Pulfrich effect in monovision after cataract surgery.	BACKGROUND: Cataracts affect the optics of the eye in terms of absorption, blur, and scattering. When cataracts are unilateral, they cause differences between the eyes that can produce visual discomfort and harm binocular vision. These interocular differences can also induce differences in the processing speed of the eyes that may cause a spontaneous Pulfrich effect, a visual illusion provoking important depth misperceptions. Interocular differences in light level, like those present in unilateral cataracts, can cause the Classic Pulfrich effect, and interocular differences in blur, like those present in monovision, a common correction for presbyopia, can cause the Reverse Pulfrich effect. The visual system may be able to adapt, or not, to the new optical condition, depending on the degree of the cataract and the magnitude of the monovision correction. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report a unique case of a 45-year-old patient that underwent unilateral cataract surgery resulting in a monovision correction of 2.5 diopters (D): left eye emmetropic after the surgery compensated with a monofocal intraocular lens and right eye myopic with a spherical equivalent of -2.50 D. This patient suffered severe symptoms in binocular vision, which can be explained by a spontaneous Pulfrich effect (a delay measured of 4.82 ms, that could be eliminated with a 0.19 optical density filter). After removing the monovision with clear lens extraction in the second eye, symptoms disappeared. We demonstrate that, at least in this patient, both Classic and Reverse Pulfrich effects coexist after unilateral cataract surgery and that can be readapted by reverting the interocular differences. Besides, we report that the adaptation/readaptation process to the Reverse Pulfrich effect happens in a timeframe of weeks, as opposed to the Classic Pulfrich effect, known to have timeframes of days. Additionally, we used the illusion measured in the laboratory to quantify the relevance of the spontaneous Pulfrich effect in different visual scenarios and tasks, using geometrical models and optic flow algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: Measuring the different versions of the Pulfrich effect might help to understand the visual discomfort reported by many patients after cataract surgery or with monovision and could guide compensation or intervention strategies.
37322682	Surgical management of lifebuoy cataract.	Lifebuoy cataract is a rare form of congenital cataract with anatomical characteristics. Herein, we present a case of an otherwise healthy 42-year-old female with a long-standing history of blurred vision. Examination showed the presence of esotropia and bilateral horizontal nystagmus. Visual acuity was limited to light perception in both eyes. Slit-lamp examination showed a calcified lens capsule with the absence of lens material in the right eye and the presence of an annular cataract in the left eye, corresponding to a unilateral lifebuoy cataract. She underwent cataract surgery with intraocular lens implantation. We report the clinical findings, anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT), and surgical management tips. We noticed that during surgery, both anterior capsulorhexis and central membrane removal were the most challenging steps due to the absence of central nucleus and the strong adherence of central membrane to the anterior hyaloid.
37237264	A very early steroid responder after cataract surgery: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Increased intraocular pressure (IOP), a side effect of corticosteroid eye drops, typically develops during the first few weeks of administration, and steroid response is not generally considered a cause of increased IOP immediately after cataract surgery. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, I report a rare case of increased IOP due to steroid eye drops immediately after surgery. A man in his 80s presented with vision loss. Bilateral cataracts and pseudoexfoliation syndrome were confirmed. Postoperative eye drops including steroid eye drops were started immediately after cataract surgery in the right eye. High IOP was observed at the next and subsequent morning visits, but IOP normalized when steroid eye drops were discontinued. After surgery on the left eye, steroids were not administered postoperatively, and no increase in IOP was observed. CONCLUSION: This case report highlights that a very early steroid response may be potential cause of elevated IOP immediately after cataract surgery.
37118661	A case report of interstitial keratitis and secondary glaucoma after cataract surgery that may be related to late congenital syphilis.	BACKGROUND: The destruction of blood eye barrier and the administration of corticosteroid eyedrops after phacoemulsification surgery can lead to the replication of the local potential pathogens. With the rapid increase and popularization of cataract surgery, all kinds of rare postoperative complications have appeared. Here, we report a case of interstitial keratitis and secondary glaucoma after cataract surgery, which may be related to late congenital syphilis, which eventually led to blindness in the right eye. We hope that the timely report of this case will enable doctors to pay more attention to the possibility of potential pathogen replication after cataract surgery, and enable more patients to receive reasonable and effective treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: A 63-year-old female was referred to our clinic for investigation with a 1-week history of moderate pain in the right eye and ipsilateral headache in January 2020. She had cataract surgery on her right eye two years ago and on her left eye one year ago. The intraocular pressure (IOP) in the right eye was 43.2 mmHg and that in the left eye was 28.5 mmHg. Her right eye underwent medication, trabeculectomy and finally was subjected to ciliary body photocoagulation to control the IOP. The IOP of the left eye was well controlled by regular use of eye drops. In addition to the elevated IOP, the inflammation of the anterior segment and corneal stroma was found. Before cataract surgery, bilateral corneal opacities was revealed, but after cataract surgery, interstitial keratitis in both eyes was gradually aggravated, during the follow-up period from 2019 to 2021. She informed us that she had suffered from decreased vision in both eyes and was diagnosed with bilateral keratitis and congenital syphilis at the age of 20. In 2018, the serologic test for syphilis was positive in blood (Chemiluminescence analysis (CLIA): + ; Toluidine red unheated serum test (TRUST): + , titer was 1:1). However, four tests for TRUST were negative in 2019 and 2020, so she was not treated for syphilis. CONCLUSION: This case of glaucoma and interstitial keratitis might be secondary to ocular inflammation caused by late congenital syphilis. The ocular inflammation and the activation of syphilis may be related to cataract surgery.
37113025	Splinter Cataract in Patients with Keratoconus and Frequent Eye Rubbing: A Novel Finding.	BACKGROUND Patients with keratoconus are at increased risk of developing cataract at a younger age compared to the normal population. Predisposing factors include atopy and topical steroid use. In this case series we report the novel observation of splinter-shaped cortical cataract in 16 eyes of 14 patients with keratoconus in the absence of other risk factors of cataract development from a single center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. CASE REPORT This is a retrospective review of 16 eyes of 14 patients diagnosed with keratoconus and found to have splinter cortical cataract. Twelve patients had unilateral and 2 patients had bilateral splinter cortical cataract in the inferotemporal quadrant of the crystalline lens. Thirteen eyes (81.25%) had clinically proven keratoconus and 3 eyes (18.75%) were keratoconus suspects. All patients affirmed frequent eye rubbing and 62.5% of eyes had a history of vernal keratoconjunctivitis. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) by the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (LogMAR) was reported between 0 to 0.2 in 69% of eyes (11 eyes) and 4 eyes (25%) had BCVA of 0.3 to 0.6, and 1 eye (6%) had BCVA of 1.3. CONCLUSIONS Splinter-shaped cortical cataract could be a sign of frequent eye rubbing. Careful examination of the crystalline lens with dilated pupil may reveal peripheral cortical opacities in the inferotemporal quadrant, which can alert the physician that the patient has habitual eye rubbing and is at increased risk of keratoconus development or progression.
36916108	Sympathetic ophthalmia in an 85-year-old female and a 90-year-old male after a non-complicated cataract surgery: a case report.	Here, two cases involving the oldest reported patients with sympathetic ophthalmia (SO) after non-complicated cataract surgery, are reported. The first case was an 85-year-old female with bilateral decreased vision and headache. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.8 in the right eye and 1.0 in the left eye at the initial visit. Pseudophakia and choroidal detachments were observed in both eyes, and retinal pigment epithelium undulation was observed by optical coherence tomography. The second case was a 90-year-old male with bilateral optic disc oedema. The BCVA was 0.09 in the right eye and 0.3 in the left eye with pseudophakic eyes. Optic disc oedema and choroidal thickening were observed in both eyes. Both patients were diagnosed with SO, and corticosteroid pulse treatments were started. The BCVA of the first case improved to 0.9 in the right eye and 1.2 in the left eye, while that of the second case reached 0.3 in the right eye and 0.6 in the left eye. No recurrence was observed in either case at 12 months after the initial visit. Both elderly patients with SO were successfully treated.
36781206	A novel <i>WFS1</i> variant associated with isolated congenital cataracts.	Biallelic variants in the <i>WFS1</i> gene are associated with Wolfram syndrome. However, recent publications document that heterozygous variants can lead to a variety of phenotypes, such as Wolfram-like syndrome or isolated features of Wolfram syndrome. In this case report, we present a male patient with a history of congenital cataracts and subjective complaints of muscle weakness. Clinical assessment demonstrated normal muscle strength, and genomic, biochemical, electrophysiologic, and muscle biopsy studies did not identify a potential cause of the proband's perceived muscle weakness. Whole-exome sequencing identified a novel de novo variant in the <i>WFS1</i> gene (c.1243G > T), representing one of only several patients in the published literature with isolated congenital cataracts and a heterozygous <i>WFS1</i> variant. The variety of phenotypes associated with heterozygous variants in <i>WFS1</i> suggests that this gene should be considered as a cause of both dominant and biallelic/recessive forms of disease. Future research should focus on elucidating the mechanism(s) of disease and variable expressivity in <i>WFS1</i> in order to improve our ability to provide patients and families with anticipatory guidance about the disease, including appropriate screening and medical interventions.
36676725	First Case Report of Developmental Bilateral Cataract with a Novel Mutation in the <i>ZEB2</i> Gene Observed in Mowat-Wilson Syndrome.	<i>Background</i>: Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is extremely rare multisystemic autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the Zinc Finger E-Box Binding Homeobox 2 (<i>ZEB2</i>) gene. Ocular pathologies are one of the symptoms that appear in the clinical picture of MWS individuals, but not many have been described so far. Pathologies such as optic nerve or retinal epithelium atrophy, iris or optic disc coloboma as well as congenital cataracts have been most frequently described until now. Therefore, we would like to report the first case of bilateral developmental cataract in a 9-year-old girl with MWS who underwent successful cataract surgery with intraocular lens implantation. <i>Case Presentation</i>: A 9-year-old girl, diagnosed with p.Gln694Ter mutation in <i>ZEB2</i> gene and suspicion of MWS was referred to the Children's Outpatient Ophthalmology Clinic for ophthalmological evaluation. Her previous assessments revealed abnormalities of the optic nerve discs. The patient was diagnosed with atrophy of the optic nerves, convergent strabismus, and with-the-rule astigmatism. One year later, during the follow-up visit, the patient was presented with decreased visual acuity (VA), developmental total cataract in the right eye and a developmental partial cataract in the left eye. This resulted in decreased VA confirmed by deteriorated responses in visual evoked potential (VEP) test. The girl underwent a two-stage procedure of cataract removal, first of one eye and then of the other eye with artificial lens implants. In the 2 years following the operation, no complications were observed and, most remarkably, VA improved significantly. <i>Conclusions</i>: The <i>ZEB2</i> gene is primarily responsible for encoding the Smad interaction protein 1 (SIP1), which is involved in the proper development of various eye components. When mutated, it results in multilevel abnormalities, also in the proper lens formation, that prevent the child from normal vision development. This typically results in the formation of congenital cataracts in children with MWS syndrome, however, our case shows that it also leads to the formation of developmental cataracts. This is presumably due to the effect of the lack of SIP1 on other genes, altering their downstream expression and is a novel insight into the importance of the SIP1 in the occurrence of ocular pathologies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of bilateral developmental cataract in the context of MWS. Moreover, a novel mutation (p.Gln694Ter) in the <i>ZEB2</i> gene was found corresponding to this syndrome entity. This report allows us to gain a more comprehensive insight into the genetic spectrum and the corresponding phenotypic features in MWS syndrome patients.
36514115	Prospective cholestanol screening of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis among patients with juvenile-onset unexplained bilateral cataracts.	BACKGROUND: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare genetic disorder related to CYP27A1 biallelic mutations, leading to decreased synthesis of bile acids and increased cholestanol. Juvenile bilateral cataracts are one of the most common findings in the disease, frequently occurring before the onset of neurological manifestations. While early treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid can prevent the onset of neurological impairment, poor awareness of CTX accounts for a markedly delayed diagnosis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of plasma cholestanol analysis at the moment of cataract diagnosis and before the onset of neurological impairment in CTX. METHODS: Multicenter prospective cohort study of patients with juvenile-onset unexplained bilateral cataracts recruited from seven French ophthalmology departments. Plasma cholestanol analysis was performed at diagnosis from January 2018 to January 2020. CYP27A1 genetic testing was performed at the ophthalmologist's discretion. Cholestanol levels were compared with those of a similar population of patients without cataracts (control cohort). RESULTS: 30 patients were finally recruited, with a mean age at cataract diagnosis of 7.1 years (± 4.8 SD, range 1-19 years). One patient had a very high cholestanol level (68 μmol/L, reference < 10) and carried two pathogenic heterozygous mutations in CYP27A1 confirming CTX. This patient was a 19-year-old female, reporting chronic diarrhea only in childhood, and diagnosed with bilateral posterior cataracts with cortical fleck-like opacities. Therefore, the incidence of CTX in our cohort of patients was 3.3%. Five further patients (5/29; 17.2%) had moderate elevations of cholestanol level (between 10.3 and 16.5 μmol/L), compared to 12/286 (4.2%) in the control cohort (p = 0.014) after adjustment for age. CONCLUSION: Our study argue for the relevance of plasma cholestanol CTX screening in all patients with juvenile-onset unexplained cataracts, even without other CTX identified manifestations. Whether moderate elevations of plasma cholestanol unrelated to CTX may be a risk factor for bilateral cataracts occurrence needs further examination.
36368969	Life-threatening hypotension in the immediate postoperative period of cataract surgery under topical anesthesia: a report of two cases.	BACKGROUND: Cataract surgery is one of the most frequent surgeries in the world. It is a very safe procedure mostly performed under topical anesthesia in outpatients centers. Due to the growing lack of anesthesiologists, cataract surgeries are more frequently performed without an anesthesiologist present in the operating room. Although extremely rare, life-threatening complications may occur. CASES PRESENTATION: We report two cases of cataract surgery complicated by severe hypotension that required emergency resuscitation in the immediate postoperative period and hospitalization in intensive care unit. Anaphylactic shock was confirmed in the first case and suspected in the second. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE: Even though cataract surgery is a very safe procedure, it is essential to ensure the presence of an anesthesiologist to manage potential, though extremely rare, life-threatening complications such as anaphylactic reactions.
36308170	Immediately sequential bilateral cataract surgery in Down syndrome.	The exponential increase in world population and average human lifespan is expected to result in geriatric population globally. The problem of preventable blindness due to cataract will increase manifold. Simultaneous Bilateral cataract surgery (SBCS) is a viable option in such subset of patients. Despite faster visual recovery, economic benefits to patients and health care providers, decreased risk of complications associated with General anaesthesia, there is significant resistance in accepting SBCS as a routine procedure. Bilateral endophthalmitis is the main deterrent in performing ISBCS. This case highlights successful ISBCS in 36 years old female patient with Down's syndrome.
36308165	"Show me the way" - Endoilluminator-assisted manual small-incision cataract surgery in a case of corneal scar with a small pupil.	Cataracts with coexisting corneal opacities due to various causes present a daunting challenge to surgeons. Adding to the plight could be factors like shallow anterior chamber, small pupil and mono-ocular patient. A manual small-incision cataract surgery (MSICS) could be a saviour in such situations. We demonstrate a case of post perforation corneal scar secondary to Hansen's disease with complicated cataract with non-dilating pupil in a bilaterally blind patient. Due to poor visualisation, there could have been difficulties in capsulorrhexsis, cortex aspiration &amp; many other intraoperative manoeuvres, but use of an endo illuminator providing oblique illumination was very useful, resulting in uneventful surgery with good visual outcome. MSCICS, a surgery with minimal instrumentation, short learning curve and comparable results to phacoemulsification is perhaps the preferred procedure, in India, for complicated cataracts with multiple pre-existing pathologies.
36107580	Lens nucleus dislocation in hypermature cataract: Case report and literature review.	INTRODUCTION: Hypermature cataract is a form of late-stage cataract progression that can lead to a variety of complications. Spontaneous capsular rupture with lens nucleus displacement in hypermature cataracts has rarely been reported. We describe 2 cases of spontaneous dislocation of the lens nucleus in a hypermature cataract and perform a review of the literature on this complication. PATIENT CONCERNS: We report 2 rural men aged 50 and 76 years with deteriorating vision. DIAGNOSIS: The final diagnosis was senile hypermature cataract with dislocation of the lens nucleus in both patients and secondary glaucoma for the second patient. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: During admission, both patients complained of deteriorating vision. Slit-lamp examination showed lens nucleus dislocation into the anterior chamber. The 50-year-old patient exhibited a residual lens capsule and a turbid cortex, with a normal anterior chamber and intraocular pressure. The 76-year-old patient presented a shrunken and ruptured capsule and no cortex in the pupillary area, mild inflammation in the anterior chamber, and high intraocular pressure. Both patients underwent intracapsular cataract extraction combined with anterior vitrectomy and achieved good postoperative recovery. CONCLUSION: Lens nucleus dislocation in hypermature cataracts can be seen in clinical practice, particularly in underdeveloped areas. Early recognition and surgery can improve vision.
35941541	Massive intraocular hemorrhage, presumably from the central retinal artery after cataract surgery, and difficult hemostasis during vitrectomy: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Severe intraocular hemorrhage is a rare complication of cataract surgery due to the recent generalization of minimal-incision cataract surgery. We report a case of a massive intraocular hemorrhage that probably originated from the central retinal artery after cataract surgery, in which hemostasis was difficult to achieve during vitrectomy. CASE PRESENTATION: An 86-year-old woman was referred to our department for intraocular lens (IOL) dislocation after undergoing cataract surgery. Massive intraocular hemorrhage was observed during the initial visit to our department. She underwent pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and IOL repositioning under local anesthesia. However, the hemorrhage could not be removed completely because of continued massive intraoperative bleeding from the posterior fundus, and it was extremely difficult to achieve hemostasis during the initial surgery. At 7 days after the initial surgery, PPVs were performed under general anesthesia. Bleeding significantly decreased in the second surgery compared to the first. The bleeding probably originated from the central retinal artery on the optic disc; hemostasis was obtained by coagulation of the bleeding site with intraocular diathermy. After the second surgery, there was no exacerbation of bleeding and the patient's condition was stable. However, the patient's visual acuity showed no light perception after the second surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Massive intraocular hemorrhage may occur from the central retinal artery after undergoing cataract surgery. In such cases, surgery with general anesthesia with a lower maintained blood pressure (instead of surgery under local anesthesia) should be recommended, considering the possibility of difficult hemostasis in the event of bleeding from the retinal artery.
35883109	Bilateral posterior scleritis after sequential bilateral cataract surgery: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Posterior scleritis is a rare, inflammatory ophthalmic disease, leading to severe visual impairment if untreated. Posterior scleritis occurring after surgery, unrelated to systemic inflammatory diseases, is even rarer. This report discusses a case of bilateral posterior scleritis, after cataract surgery in both the eyes, treated with high-dose steroids. CASE PRESENTATION: A 55-year-old man, who had undergone bilateral sequential cataract surgery one week before, presented with sudden loss of vision and ocular pain in both eyes. The patient had no systemic diseases or neurological symptoms. Serous retinal detachment of the macula with optic disc swelling was observed on fundus examination in both the eyes, and bilateral thickening of choroid and sclera was seen in ultrasonography. Under diagnosis of bilateral posterior scleritis due to the increased signal of sclera in both the eyes on magnetic resonance imaging, high-dose steroid therapy was performed. After treatment, improvement in visual acuity and retinal detachment were observed, and thereafter, it has been maintained without relapse. CONCLUSIONS: With high-dose steroid therapy, we successfully treated a rare case of bilateral posterior scleritis following cataract surgery in both eyes. To our knowledge, this is the first report on posterior scleritis occurring after surgery, unrelated to systemic inflammatory diseases.
35801772	Hyperacute iris neovascularization following cataract surgery.	RATIONALE: We describe a case of acute neovascularization of the iris after uneventful cataract surgery. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 78-year-old man visited our clinic for cataract surgery and glaucoma management. DIAGNOSES: The patient underwent bilateral laser iridotomy 4 years ago. On ocular examination, the best-corrected visual acuity was no light perception in the right eye and 20/100 in the left eye. We observed pseudophakic bullous keratopathy in the right eye and cataracts and hemicentral retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) in the left eye. INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent cataract surgery in the left eye without complications. OUTCOMES: The day after surgery we observed 360° of neovascularization in the iris and aggravated hemi-CRVO with macular edema. Therefore, we administered intravitreal bevacizumab in the left eye, after which the iris neovascularization and macular edema improved. LESSONS: Cataract surgery can rapidly aggravate hemi-CRVO and cause iris neovascularization, which is responsive to bevacizumab.
35758381	Spontaneous resolution of a unilateral cataract in an adult: A case report.	RATIONALE: Cataracts are a disease that is usually caused by aging and involve the irreversible degeneration of the lens material. On the other hand, transient cataracts have also been reported, mainly due to systemic hyperglycemia, which often occurs bilaterally. However, reports of the spontaneous regression of unilaterally occurring cataracts in patients with normal blood glucose levels are rare. Here, we report a rare case of spontaneous regression of unilateral posterior subcapsular cataracts in an adult with normal blood glucose levels. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 42-year-old woman presented with distorted vision in her right eye. The patient was taking medication for diabetes, and her blood sugar level was well-controlled. DIAGNOSIS: Upon examination, her uncorrected visual acuity and best-corrected visual acuity were 20/70 in her right eye. Slit lamp microscopy revealed fine, feathery, and streak-like posterior subcapsular opacities. Color fundus photography revealed a star-shaped shadow due to the cataract, and no diabetic retinopathy was observed. Her two hour postprandial glucose level was 115 mg/dL. The patient was diagnosed with posterior subcapsular cataracts, and cataract surgery was planned. The patient was scheduled to visit the clinic again after seven days. INTERVENTIONS: Close observation for one week without any intervention. OUTCOMES: After one week, most of the posterior subcapsular opacities disappeared, and the uncorrected visual acuity and best-corrected visual acuity in the right eye improved to 20/40 and 20/30, respectively. LESSONS: This case report demonstrates that unilateral posterior subcapsular cataracts may spontaneously regress in patients with normal blood glucose levels. Therefore, it is important to check whether cataracts improve spontaneously through short-term close follow-up before planning cataract surgery to avoid unnecessary surgery.
35758354	Intraoperative malignant glaucoma during femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery: A case report.	RATIONALE: Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) has grown in popularity among ophthalmologists as a novel surgical technique. However, malignant glaucoma (MG) is a complication of FLACS. Herein, we report a case of MG following FLACS. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 66-year-old woman presented with complaints of blurred vision in the right eye and a foreign body sensation in both eyes. Ophthalmological examinations showed that the corrected distance visual acuity was 20/50 and 20/25 in the right and left eyes, respectively. Without any topical anti-glaucoma medication, the intraocular pressure (IOP) was 20 mmHg in the right eye and 17 mmHg in the left eye. Slit-lamp examination of the right eye revealed a transparent cornea with a defect in the punctate overlying epithelium; the central anterior chamber depth was shallow the peripheral iris laser shot was visible, the pupil was normal, and the lens was mainly cortical opacified. DIAGNOSES: Based on the patient's symptoms, examination results, and preliminary diagnoses, age-related cataract in the right eye, binocular post-antiglaucoma surgery, pseudophakicin in the left eye, and Sjogren syndrome were included. INTERVENTIONS: FLACS was performed to facilitate anterior capsulotomy and segmentation of the nucleus in the right eye. MG occurred after the femtosecond procedure, and with the treatment of medicines combined with phacoemulsification, IOP was eventually normal without further antiglaucoma therapy. OUTCOMES: IOP was 16 mmHg on postoperative day 1. Ocular ultrasonography revealed no choroid detachment or hemorrhage in the right eye. Two weeks postoperatively, uncorrected visual acuity was 20/25, and IOP remained normal with no further antiglaucoma treatment on 1 month postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the occurrence of MG after FLACS and illustrate that miosis and bubble formation after FLACS may be risk factors for MG during FLACS.
35630106	Cataract Surgery after Radial Keratotomy with Non-Diffractive Extended Depth of Focus Lens Implantation.	Radial keratotomy was a popular surgical procedure used to treat myopia. Patients who underwent radial keratotomy several years ago, are currently reporting to the ophthalmologist due to worsening of vision associated with age-related cataracts. In this case report we present a case of a 60-year-old woman who underwent radial keratotomy with 16 incisions in the right eye and 12 incisions in the left eye. The patient reported to an ophthalmologist due to a deterioration of vision caused by a cataract. We described, in detail, the difficulties encountered during the diagnostic procedures, differences in the calculation of intraocular lens, and intraoperative difficulties as compared to patients who had not undergone radial keratotomy. We also present the obtained postoperative results.
35397531	Acute cataract by a high-intensity focused ultrasound procedure: a case report.	BACKGROUND: We report a case of acute onset of cataract after eyelid rejuvenation tightening with intense focused ultrasound (IFUS) treatment without using a protection device. CASE PRESENTATION: A 47-year-old female patient presented at the outpatient clinic with blurred vision in her left eye immediately after undergoing an eyelid tightening procedure, using IFUS, seven days prior. The patient had decreased vision in her left eye, caused by an acute cataract with several drop-like opacities and a rosette-like posterior subcapsular cataract. One month after her first visit, the patient's visual acuity in her left eye decreased to 20/630. A Swept-Source Anterior Segment optical coherence tomography confirmed that the posterior capsule was not ruptured. The patient underwent uneventful phacoemulsification cataract surgery with intraocular lens implantation, which resulted in full visual recovery. CONCLUSIONS: This case emphasized the need to evaluate possible ocular side effects, resulting from periocular IFUS without a protection device, including severe cataract requiring surgery.
35362222	S1P defects cause a new entity of cataract, alopecia, oral mucosal disorder, and psoriasis-like syndrome.	In this report, we discovered a new entity named cataract, alopecia, oral mucosal disorder, and psoriasis-like (CAOP) syndrome in two unrelated and ethnically diverse patients. Furthermore, patient 1 failed to respond to regular treatment. We found that CAOP syndrome was caused by an autosomal recessive defect in the mitochondrial membrane-bound transcription factor peptidase/site-1 protease (MBTPS1, S1P). Mitochondrial abnormalities were observed in patient 1 with CAOP syndrome. Furthermore, we found that S1P is a novel mitochondrial protein that forms a trimeric complex with ETFA/ETFB. S1P enhances ETFA/ETFB flavination and maintains its stability. Patient S1P variants destabilize ETFA/ETFB, impair mitochondrial respiration, decrease fatty acid β-oxidation activity, and shift mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to glycolysis. Mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammatory lesions in patient 1 were significantly ameliorated by riboflavin supplementation, which restored the stability of ETFA/ETFB. Our study discovered that mutations in MBTPS1 resulted in a new entity of CAOP syndrome and elucidated the mechanism of the mutations in the new disease.
35248002	Herpetic uveitis caused by herpes simplex virus after cataract surgery in a patient without prior viral keratitis or uveitis: a case report.	BACKGROUND: To report a case of herpetic uveitis caused by herpes simplex virus after cataract surgery in a patient without prior viral keratitis or uveitis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 70-year-old female was referred to our clinic with a 16-day history of acute blurry vision with painful redness in the right eye. She accepted cataract surgery for the right eye ten days before initial of ocular symptoms. There was significant inflammation in anterior chamber of the right eye. Retina exam showed moderate dense vitreous opacity but not necrotic or focal retinal lesion in the right eye. The aqueous humor collected from the right eye was positive for herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA by PCR. The diagnosis of herpetic uveitis in the right eye was made due to clinical presentations and aqueous humor examination. CONCLUSION: Herpetic virus reactivation might occasionally occur after intraocular surgery in patients without prior ocular viral diseases, inducing atypical postoperative intraocular inflammation.
35247993	Recurrent ligneous conjunctivitis after cataract surgery in a 67-year-old male patient: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Ligneous conjunctivitis is a rare form of chronic pseudomembranous conjunctivitis which usually starts during infancy. We report on an unsual case of recurrent ligneous conjunctivitis after cataract surgery in a 67-year-old male patient. METHODS: The equipment used for the slit-lamp images was a Haag Streit slit lamp BX900 Sn 00,406 with 16 × magnifications. The used batch number of the camera was sn00406 and the software was from the company CCS Pawlowski Merge Eye. There were no filters used. The images were saved with a resolution of 300 DPI. Neither downstream nor averaging was used to enhance the resolution of the image in the case presentation section or the figure legend. The equipment used for the cross-sectional histologic images was a Zeiss Axioskop 40 microscope with an objective lens Zeiss A-Plan × 20/0.45 (Zoom 6.3 × TV 2/3″″C). The used camera was AxioCam MRc5 and the software was ZEN 3.2. The cross-sectional histologic images were saved with a resolution of 2584 × 1936 Pixels. Neither downstream nor averaging was used to enhance the resolution of the image in the case presentation section or the figure legend. CASE PRESENTATION: This is a rare case report of ligneous conjunctivitis in a 67-year-old male patient who presented a recurrent conjunctival granuloma after five excisions following cataract surgery in his left eye. We performed a tumor excision with free conjunctival autograft. The histology showed a fibrin crust including macrophages, granulocytes, lymphocytes, and reactively altered squamous cell nests. These findings were consistent with a ″pseudomembrane in conjunctivitis lignosa″. We administered a topical combination of plasminactivator, heparin, cortisone and cyclosporine. CONCLUSION: This treatment with the combination of plasminactivator, heparin, cortisone and cyclosporine has proven to be effective in preventing the recurrence of ligneous conjunctivitis.
35087984	Retinal detachment in UGH Syndrome after cataract surgery.	<b>Purpose:</b> To report a case of retinal detachment (RD) in a UGH Syndrome after cataract surgery and to emphasize special aspects of the management, along with factors that must be considered. <b>Methods:</b> We present the case of a 56-year-old man who underwent cataract surgery with a capsulorhexis leak, but the implantation of the lens in the sac did not hinder. 8 months after surgery, he presented several episodes of hypertensive uveitis that produced a progression in the excavation of the optic nerve head from 3/10 to 9/10 despite the treatment with ocular hypotensive drugs. He went to the emergency department due to sudden loss of vision during which a complete hemovitreous with a zone of transillumination and atrophy of the temporal sector of the iris were observed. Echo-B showed inferior retinal detachment. The apposition of the intraocular lens over the temporal region of the iris was observed in anterior segment OCT. Scleral band pars plana vitrectomy surgery was performed. <b>Results:</b> Currently, the VA RE was 6/10 with controlled IOP without the need for treatment, the excavation was 9/10 and it preserved an island of inferior paracentral vision in the perimetry. Vitrectomy favored the posterior displacement of the lens, avoiding friction of the iris, thus eliminating outbreaks of hypertensive uveitis. <b>Conclusions:</b> It is important to be aware of the mechanisms of uveitis-glaucoma-hyphema (UGH) syndrome. It is necessary to identify postoperative signs to make a diagnosis as soon as possible. It is time to consider that UGH syndrome can be caused by any type of pseudophakic lens.
35052432	A Novel <i>GEMIN4</i> Variant in a Consanguineous Family Leads to Neurodevelopmental Impairment with Severe Microcephaly, Spastic Quadriplegia, Epilepsy, and Cataracts.	Pathogenic variants in <i>GEMIN4</i> contribute to a hereditary disorder characterized by neurodevelopmental features, microcephaly, cataracts, and renal abnormalities (known as NEDMCR). To date, only two homoallelic variations have been linked to the disease. Moreover, clinical features associated with the variants have not been fully elucidated yet. Here, we identified a novel variant in <i>GEMIN4</i> (NM_015721:exon2:c.440A>G:p.His147Arg) in two siblings from a consanguineous Saudi family by using whole exome sequencing followed by Sanger sequence verification. We comprehensively investigated the patients' clinical features, including brain imaging and electroencephalogram findings, and compared their phenotypic characteristics with those of previously reported cases. In <i>silico</i> prediction and structural modeling support that the p.His147Arg variant is pathogenic.
35036658	Lens-induced uveitis in a patient with hypermature cataract.	<b>Objective:</b> Our paper aims to report an unusual case of phacogenic uveitis with secondary glaucoma occurring after spontaneous rupture of the lens capsule in a patient with hypermature age-related cataract, to describe its particularities and to review the classification of the lens-induced uveitis. <b>Methods:</b> We described the case of an 83-year-old male with a history of hypermature cataract, who presented to our clinic for right eye pain. Examination revealed circumciliary congestion, diffuse corneal edema, lens debris floating in the anterior chamber, pseudohypopyon and the opacification of the whole lens. An elevated intraocular pressure was also associated. We did not observe any history of previous intraocular surgery or trauma. <b>Results:</b> We diagnosed the case as a phacogenic uveitis with secondary glaucoma and we planned to remove the inflammation trigger, namely the lens and its fragments by the most adequate technique, in order to control the inflammation and the IOP spikes, to alleviate the pain and to improve the patient's visual function and the quality of life. <b>Conclusions:</b> Phacogenic uveitis may present a cloudy cornea and a turbid anterior chamber that mimics endophthalmitis. Careful examination, medical history and ancillary investigations are helpful in establishing an accurate diagnosis and the appropriate treatment can reduce or eliminate the inflammation completely, decrease the intraocular pressure, being able to allow, depending on the particularities of the case, the visual gain.
35036650	Surgical management of an adult patient with Cataract and bilateral Ectopia Lentis: a case report.	A 48-year-old female patient presented to the Ophthalmology Clinic with gradual loss of vision in both eyes over the last year. Upon slit lamp examination, cortical and nuclear opacities of the lens in BE and a 180-degree zonular dehiscence with moderate bilateral superotemporal dislocation of the lens were revealed. After a series of necessary investigations, the patient was admitted for surgery. This case report represents an addition to the diagnosis, challenges and the latest surgical techniques and instruments.
31391702	Simultaneous Penetrating Keratoplasty, Cataract Removal and Intraocular Lens Implantation in Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina.	INTRODUCTION: It is known that simultaneous penetrating keratoplasty, cataract removal and intraocular lens implantation are always a big challenge to a surgeon, especially in developing countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina. In these cases there is always a higher rate of different kind of intraoperative complications. Phacoemulsification after penetrating keratoplasty especially in older people may cause significant endothelial injury and also could affect long term graft survival. AIM: The aim of this report is to describe one of these challenging cases and the possible ways to manage them in developing countries. CASE REPORT: In this paper we report a case of a 46 year-old female patient, with a cataract on her right eye with a central corneal leukoma. She reported that when she was 6 years old, she had an eye injury with corn leaf. At the age of 10 year she reported that she had another injury of the same eye with a glass. She reported that she wasn't seeing quite good after that. Three years ago she had a transplantation of amniotic membrane due ulcer on the same eye. She reported also that even after this procedure she wasn't seeing quite good. Now she was admitted to hospital for a triple surgical procedure. At that moment patient has been ophthalmological examined (visual acuity testing, biomicroscopy, tonometry, ultrasound of both eyes with biometry and ophthalmoscopy). At the day of admission to the hospital on slit lamp we found central corneal leukoma, occlusion of pupil and complicated cataract. Before surgery her Uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) on her left eye was light perception. A combined procedure of penetrating keratoplasty (PKP), open-sky cataract extraction, and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation was planned. Thirty days after surgery her visual acuity was 0,5 without correction. It is concluded that cataract surgery in patients after keratoplasty is more complicated. CONCLUSION: Therefore, these patients should be managed with utmost care and operated by an experienced surgeon.
31146719	How many challenges we may encounter in anterior megalophthalmos with white cataract: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Anterior megalophthalmos is a rare congenital disease which mainly features enlargement of the anterior segment. Cataract surgeries in anterior megalophthalmos can be challenging due to the anatomical anomalies while the studies upon the surgical design have been less integrated. CASE PRESENTATION: A 37-year-old woman presented with progressively blurred vision in the right eye after a transient fever 10 months ago. Her ocular history included hypermetropia with a spherical equivalent of + 4.00 OU. The review of systems showed bilateral varus deformity of distal interphalangeal joints on the little fingers. The patient denied family history of hereditary ocular diseases and her sister was born with uterus didelphys. On initial examinations, the corrected distance visual acuity was hand motion OD and 20/33 OS. Her intraocular pressure was 15 mmHg OD and 16 mmHg OS. Horizontal corneal diameter was 14 mm OD and 13.88 mm OS and axial length was 24.87 mm OD and 25 mm OS. Anterior segment photography showed bilateral iridal atrophy with deficiency in pupillary dilation and white cortically mature cataract in the right eye. Inspection by anterior segment optical coherence tomography indicated bilateral augmented anterior chambers with backward iridal concave on horizontal orientation. Ultrasound biomicroscopy showed partially peripheral anterior synechiae and pectinate ligaments at chamber angle in both eyes and opacified lens with the apparently elongated suspensory ligaments in the right eye. A deliberately selected 1-piece foldable intraocular lens (IOL) with frame haptics was implanted after phacoemulsification for good IOL stability. During the follow-up, the visual rehabilitation appeared relatively good and a lower degree of IOL dislocation comparing with existing reports was verified by OPD-Scan III aberrometry. CONCLUSIONS: We presented the challenges and the original findings from a case of congenital anterior megalophthalmos with white cataract who underwent phacoemulsification and IOL implantation. This is the first report describing the comparison of the different IOL power calculation formulas in anterior megalophthalmos. Compared to the SRK/T and the Holladay II formulas, the Haigis formula could be a more accurate choice for the IOL calculation in anterior megalophthalmos according to our case. Moreover, the deliberate selection of IOLs is essential for IOL stability in these patients.
30900600	Systemic toxicity of topical corticosteroids.	Corticosteroids are known to cause many ocular and systemic side effects when administered by oral or parenteral routes. Corticosteroid induced systemic toxicity secondary to topical steroid eye drops is rare. A 6-week-old, male infant was brought to our tertiary eye care center with bilateral congenital cataracts. The child underwent phacoaspiration with primary posterior capsulotomy without intraocular lens implantation in both eyes at an interval of 6 weeks. Child was initiated on topical betamethsone 0.1% eight times a day, tobramycin 0.3% six times a day, homatropine 2% twice a day, and carboxymethylcellulose 0.5% four times a day. Two and four weeks later he underwent surgical membranectomy in the right and left eye respectively followed by frequent use of topical steroids, initially given 1 hourly and then tapered weekly in the follow-up period. The patient showed increase in intraocular pressure and gain in body weight along with development of cushingoid habitus nearly 6 to 8 weeks after starting topical steroids. These side effects started weaning off following the reduction in dose of topical steroids, suggesting the role of the corticosteroid-related systemic side effects. This case highlights the serious systemic side effects secondary to increased frequency and duration of topical corticosteroid use in infancy. Hence, dosage of topical steroids should be adjusted in its therapeutic range to prevent their ocular and systemic side effects. Therefore, close monitoring is advocated for children using topical corticosteroids to prevent serious ocular and systemic side effects.
30890130	X-linked inheritances recessive of congenital nystagmus and autosomal dominant inheritances of congenital cataracts coexist in a Chinese family: a case report and literature review.	BACKGROUND: Congenital nystagmus (CN) and congenital cataracts are distinct eye diseases and are usually isolated. Cases with CN and congenital cataracts caused by different genes in one family have been rarely reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 27-year-old man presented with CN and congenital cataracts and he underwent cataract extraction 2 weeks after birth. Three years later, he had posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation. The proband's mother was only afflicted by bilateral lens opacities. Lensectomy was performed in both eyes at age 15. The proband's daughter had bilateral central cataracts and no nystagmus. She had undergone cataract extraction when she was two months old. In this family, 8 affected individuals were affected by bilateral cataracts, and three of them presented with CN. The genetic analysis was performed using a specific Hereditary Ophthalmological Disease Gene Panel on proband and his parents (one of which was a patient). PCR and Sanger sequencing verified the presence of these variants in all members of the family. The novel mutation, c.498-3C > T, in FRMD7 explains why X-Linked recessive inheritance of CN was found in a subset of patients. A heterozygous mutation of the GJA8 gene (c.139G > C), was identified in all patients and thus explains the autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance of congenital cataracts within the family. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first time that FRMD7 and GJA8 gene mutations have been linked to the pathogenesis of a family with both CN and congenital cataracts. The phenomenon of two different genetic patterns coexisting in one family is rare.
30882657	Bilateral congenital macular coloboma and cataract: A case report.	RATIONALE: The case with congenital macular coloboma and cataract was rarely reported, and the pathogenic gene of the disease is still not clear. Moreover, it is difficult to improve the visual acuity of the eye with this disease. PATIENT CONCERNS: An 11-year-old boy presented low visual acuity and horizontal nystagmus in both eyes. Ophthalmologic examination showed the patient with bilateral congenital coloboma and cataract. The visual acuity of the patient improved slightly after cataract surgery. Heterozygous mutations of frizzled-4 (FZD4) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) were identified by next-generation sequencing in this case. DIAGNOSIS: Congenital macular coloboma and cataract of both eyes. INTERVENTIONS: We performed the standard phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation on both eyes of the patient for the treatment of congenital cataract, and then followed up the fundus lesions regularly. OUTCOMES: Cataract surgery may improve the visual acuity of the eyes with congenital macular coloboma and cataract at some degree, but the vision of this patient was still very poor postoperatively. Furthermore, the heterozygous mutations of FZD4 and NOD2 were found in this patient. LESSONS: Cataract surgery may improve the visual acuity of the eyes with congenital macular coloboma and cataract at some degree, and heterozygous mutations of FZD4 and NOD2 may be involved in the occurrence of congenital macular coloboma and cataract.
30606142	Rapid progression of cataract to mature stage after intravitreal dexamethasone implant injection: a case report.	BACKGROUND: This study aims to report a case of rapid progression of cataract to mature stage after intravitreal dexamethasone implantation for macular edema due to branch retinal vein occlusion. CASE PRESENTATION: A 59-year-old Korean male with complaints of sudden metamorphopsia and reduced visual acuity for three days in the left eye was referred to our clinic. Ophthalmological investigations included fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography. In the left eye, branch retinal vein occlusion with macular edema was observed. We performed intravitreal dexamethasone implantation in the left eye three times within a period of one year. One week after the third intravitreal dexamethasone implantation, grade 1 posterior subcapsular opacity and raised intraocular pressure were observed in the left eye. Three weeks later, mature cataract was observed in the left eye. We performed cataract surgery along with intravitreal ranibizumab injection in the left eye. The procedure was uneventful, and the visual acuity improved postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Posterior subcapsular cataract developed due to intravitreal dexamethasone implantation can progress rapidly to mature stage. Therefore, short-term follow-up examinations may be necessary for early diagnosis and treatment of this complication.
30605941	Spontaneous Lens Absorption Initially Misdiagnosed as Crystalline Lens Luxation.	Spontaneous lens absorption (SLA) is a rare complication of hypermature cataract. However, this condition has been reported in several cases of hypermature cataracts that were caused by trauma, senility, uveitic disorders such as Fuchs’ uveitis syndrome (FUS), and infectious disorders including leptospirosis and rubella. We report a case of spontaneous absorption of a hypermature cataract secondary to FUS. To our knowledge, this is the first report of SLA that was followed by dislocation of the capsular remnants into the vitreous and resulted in a misdiagnosis as crystalline lens luxation.
30605939	Sectoral Ciliary Body Agenesis Complicated with Cataract Formation Diagnosed by Ultrasound Biomicroscopy.	We aimed to present a novel case of sectoral ciliary body agenesis and complicated cataract as an embryogenic defect of eye development diagnosed by ultrasound biomicroscopy. A 20-year-old male patient presented with a complaint of visual impairment in his left eye since childhood. Slit-lamp examination of the left eye revealed pigment precipitation and focal lens opacities extending from the temporal quadrant through the posterior lens capsule, blocking the central optical axis. On ultrasound biomicroscopy examination, there was a hyperechoic reflection belonging to the rudimentary ciliary body structures between 2-5 o’clock in the temporal quadrant. The zonules could not be visualized in the same location. At all other quadrants of the anterior chamber angle, the ciliary body and zonules were normal. This is a very rare case of sectoral ciliary body agenesis complicated by cataract. Ultrasound biomicroscopy may be useful for detecting rare congenital anomalies of the anterior segment, anterior chamber angle, and ciliary body.
30219777	Unilateral cataract associated with eyelid ash-leaf macule in tuberous sclerosis complex.	A 9-month-old male child with tuberous sclerosis complex presented with ash-leaf macules on the left periocular region and ipsilateral dense cataract. Fundus showed retinal astrocytic hamartomas. This case is reported for unilaterality of congenital cataract on the same side of eyelid ash-leaf macule in tuberous sclerosis.
30157798	Toric IOL implantation in a patient with keratoconus and previous penetrating keratoplasty: a case report and review of literature.	BACKGROUND: Cataract surgery in patients with keratoconus with or without previous penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) can be demanding due to difficulties in selecting the intraocular lens (IOL) and predicting the refractive outcome. We report a case of cataract surgery in a patient with keratoconus and previous PKP in one eye. CASE PRESENTATION: A 71-year-old man with bilateral cataract and advanced bilateral keratoconus and previous PKP in the left eye. Preoperatively, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/150, with - 5.75 sph - 9.75 cyl 72°, in the right eye and 20/40, with - 0.25 sph - 5.0 cyl 50°, in the left eye. The patient was subjected to phacoemulsification with implantation of a spherical IOL in the right eye and a toric IOL in the left eye. BCVA postoperatively was 20/80 with + 1.25 sph - 3 cyl 65° in the right eye and 20/25 with - 0.5 sph - 3.25 cyl 80° in the left eye. CONCLUSIONS: Correction of post-PKP astigmatism and cataract with phacoemulsification and implantation of a toric IOL can be an effective and safe choice. Predicting the refractive outcome in cataract surgery is difficult in patients with advanced keratoconus even when using non-toric IOLs, and the surgeon should be aware of different sources of biometric errors and the possible consequences.
30029635	Reversible cataract after exposure to distilled water: a case report.	BACKGROUND: To report a case of a reversible cataract after intracameral infusion of distilled water during full-thickness astigmatic keratotomy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 20-year-old male whose bilateral anterior chambers were exposed to distilled water during astigmatic keratotomy developed bilateral corneal edema, inflammation of the anterior chambers, and an anterior subcapsular cataract in the right eye. After 1 month of topical administration of 0.1% prednisolone acetate and 5% NaCl, the bilateral inflammation of the cornea and anterior chambers cleared; endothelial cell density decreased by 41.1% in the right eye and 12.7% in the left eye. The cataract in the right eye decreased centripetally. Small incision lenticule extraction surgery was performed at 2 months after the astigmatic keratotomy; the patient's uncorrected distance visual acuity 3 months later was 20/25 in both eyes. CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that a cataract that develops as a result of instantaneous intracameral exposure to distilled water is reversible.
29970067	Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery with implantation of a diffractive trifocal intraocular lens after laser in situ keratomileusis: a case report.	BACKGROUND: We report for the first time, a case of femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) with implantation of a diffractive trifocal intraocular lens (IOL) after laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old man underwent FLACS uneventfully 15 years after myopic LASIK. An AT Lisa tri 839MP IOL was implanted with the expectation of spectacle independence. The Haigis-L formula was chosen for calculation of the IOL power and it provided reliable results. Three months postoperatively, the uncorrected visual acuities were 0.00 logMAR for distance, 0.10 logMAR for intermediate, and 0.10 logMAR for near. CONCLUSIONS: This case suggested that FLACS presents a feasible surgical technique for post-LASIK eyes and that implantation of trifocal IOL can achieve good visual performance in strictly selected cases after myopic LASIK.
29549136	Sequential cataract surgeries in a patient with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD).	The population of patients on left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) has increased significantly since the 1990s, and with it, need for non-cardiac elective surgeries. Presence of an LVAD or heart failure, however, can cause physicians to perceive these patients to be at prohibitively high risk for elective surgery. Nevertheless, as one of the most common causes of poor vision in the elderly, cataracts can significantly limit improvements in quality of life that a patient may have otherwise gained from LVAD support. We describe the case of a 62-year-old man with an LVAD who underwent two uncomplicated sequential cataract surgeries following extensive cardiology evaluations and intraoperative monitoring by anaesthesia without intravenous sedation. The patient reported significant improvement in visual acuity and quality of life. Our case demonstrates the potential benefits of conducting cataract surgery relatively early in the disease course in patients with LVAD devices.
29450372	Penetrating corneal wound with traumatic cataract and intraocular foreign body-case report.	Open globe injuries complicated with the presence of an intraocular foreign body mostly affect young males and represent a vision threatening condition. We presented the case of a 48-year-old male who presented to our emergency service due to ocular pain and blurred vision in his right eye. A metallic foreign body situated between 1 and 12 o'clock, near the corneoscleral limbus, that perforated the cornea, the iris, the anterior capsule of the lens and the lens, was detected at the slit-lamp examination. We decided to immediately remove the foreign body that was approximately 20 mm long. The following day, traumatic cataract had already developed, so we performed cataract extraction. Despite the dimensions of the intraocular foreign body, the retina was attached and there were no sign of retinal tears or vitreous haemorrhage. The proper management in this case led to good results in spite of the dimensions of the intraocular foreign body. <b>Abbreviations:</b> IOFB = Intraocular Foreign Body, IOL = Intraocular Lens, PVR = Proliferative Vitreo-Retinopathy.
29049230	Goniosynechialysis combined with cataract extraction for iridoschisis: A case report.	RATIONALE: Iridoschisis is a rare eye disease. In this case report, we described the examination and diagnosis of a case of iridoschisis accompanied by secondary glaucoma. We also observed the effects of treating the patient with a combination of goniosynechialysis and cataract removal. PATIENT CONCERN: A 67-year-old female patient presented with decreased vision in both eyes. An eye examination indicated that visual acuities (VAs) were 20/100 and light perception in the right and left eyes, respectively. Both eyes exhibited shallow anterior chambers and narrow angles. The lower portion of the iris was loosened, and cable-like tissue was visible. The intraocular pressures in the right and left eyes were 22 mmHg and 58 mmHg, respectively. At the time of presentation, no medication was being used. DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with iridoschisis [oculus sinister (OU), indicates left eye], secondary glaucoma (OU), senile cataract (OU), and pterygium (oculus uterque, indicates both eyes). INTERVENTION: After relevant examinations were conducted, goniosynechialysis and phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation were performed on the right eye under local anesthesia. OUTCOMES: Two days after surgery, the right eye had VA of 20/40 and a transparent cornea. The anterior chamber was deeper, and intraocular pressure had decreased to 16 mmHg. Three months after surgery, the patient exhibited improved VA in the right eye and a lower IOP of 11 mmHg. LESSONS: Relative to other approaches, goniosynechialysis combined with cataract removal is a better treatment option for iridoschisis complicated with closed-angle glaucoma triggered by peripheral anterior synechiae.
29044088	Management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension in an infant with bilateral congenital cataract and associated comitant sensory esotropia.	In this report, we describe the management of a child with bilateral cataract, nystagmus, and comitant sensory esotropia. Routine ultrasonography done before cataract surgery revealed bilateral disc edema confirmed as idiopathic intracranial hypertension by a pediatric neurologist. The primary intervention for cataract surgery was followed by nonresolving papilledema, despite maximum medical therapy. To salvage the optic nerve function in a nonverbal child, bilateral optic nerve sheath decompression was planned with simultaneous medial rectus recessions for the persistent esotropia with the satisfactory postoperative outcome.
28974839	Phacoemulsification After Penetrating Keratoplasty Due War Injury at Young Adult.	INTRODUCTION: It is known that phacoemulsification of cataracts after penetrating keratoplasty there are always some difficulties and of course a higher rate of different intraoperative complications. Phacoemulsification after PK may cause significant endothelial injury and affect long term graft survival. AIM: The aim of this report is to describe one of these cases and the possible ways to manage them. CASE REPORT: We report a case o of a 31-year-old female patient, with a cataract on her left eye. She reported that when she was 10 years old, she was admitted to regional hospital in Bosnia and Herzegovina due perforative corneal war injury. At the age of 11 years at Germany on her left eye corneal transplantation was performed. She reported that she wasn't ever seeing quite good, due high myopia. Twenty years after war injury she was admitted to hospital. At that moment patient has been ophthalmologicaly examined (visual acuity testing, biomicroscopy, tonometry, ultrasound of both eyes with biometry and ophthalmoscopy). At the day of admission to the hospital on slit lamp we found occlusion of pupil and complicated cataract. Her only wish was to get operated due cosmetic reasons. Before surgery her visual acuity on her left eye was light perception. Thirty days after surgery her visual acuity was 0,1 without correction. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that cataract surgery in patients after keratoplasty is more complicated. Therefore, these patients should be managed with utmost care and operated by an experienced surgeon.
28905836	Rare ocular manifestations in keratosis follicularis (Darier-White disease).	Keratosis follicularis (Darier's disease) is a rare (1 in 30,000-100,000) genetic autosomal-dominant predominantly dermatological disorder characterized by hyperkeratosis and acantholysis due to a defective calcium transport in the cells. Ocular findings, if present, are very rare in this condition. Here, we are reporting a case of keratosis follicularis (Darier's disease) with ocular manifestations that have not been reported so far to the best of our knowledge.
28751510	Optimising the surgical outcome in a case of post-traumatic cataract using ultrasound biomicroscopy.	A 12-year-old boy was brought with the chief complaint of diminution of vision in his left eye for the past 1 month. History revealed a blunt trauma to his left eye with a wooden stick 6â€‰weeks ago.Visual acuity was 20/20 and hand movement close to face in right and left eye, respectively, without any relative afferent pupillarydefect. Slit-lamp examination showed a total cataractous lens with signs suggestive of suspected posterior capsular (PC) defect. The PC defect was screened initially using B-scan ultrasound of the posterior segment, followed by confirmation of the same using ultrasound biomicroscopy. Left eye lens aspiration along with limited anterior vitrectomy followed by placement of multipiece intraocular lens in the sulcus was performed. Best-corrected visual acuity at 6 months of follow-up was 20/20.
28746174	Traumatic cataract in patient with anterior megalophthalmos: Case report.	RATIONALE: Megalophthalmos anterior is a rare, bilateral, nonprogressive, hereditary, congenital disorder, characterized by the enlargement of all anterior segment structures of the eye, with megalocornea, iris atrophy, and zonular abnormalities commonly found. Usually almost asymptomatic in young patients, with most complaints concerning blurred vision due to the common corneal astigmatism, it might in time lead to several complications including premature cataract formation and pigmentary glaucoma. PATIENT CONCERNS: This review presents the case of a 47-year old patient referred to our clinic for traumatic cataract surgery, with striking bilateral megalocornea, somehow overlooked during previous ophthalmic examinations in his local outpatient clinic. DIAGNOSIS: We noticed markedly enlarged corneas and deepened anterior chambers of his both eyes, accompanied by intumescent, white cataract of the right eye, and incipient cortical cataract of the left eye. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was counting fingers in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye. Additional examination revealed multiple abnormalities of the anterior segment, leading to the diagnosis of anterior megalophthalmos. It is astounding the patient remained undiagnosed during previous examinations, with his megalocornea and remarkably deep anterior chamber so apparent. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: We performed standard phacoemulsification procedure, with 3 piece posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL) implantation into the lens capsule. The surgery was uneventful, with postoperative BCVA of 20/20 in the right eye, and no dislocation of the lens in 9-month observation period. LESSONS: Complicated cataract in patients with anterior megalophthalmos can be successfully treated with standard phacoemulsification procedure followed by the bag PCIOL implantation.Care needs to be taken during cataract surgery in these patients, as zonular abnormalities and lens enlargement are common, resulting in increased rate of intra- and postoperative complications. As patients with anterior megalophthalmos require a more careful follow-up.
28723783	Novel surgical management of cyclodialysis cleft via anterior chamber perfusion: Case report.	RATIONALE: Cyclodialysis cleft is a relatively rare but severe condition with persistent ocular hypotony, which can cause morphologic changes and visual loss. Here we report a case of a traumatic cyclodialysis cleft that was successfully managed with direct cyclopexy via anterior chamber perfusion. During the operation, if there is aqueous humor flowing out of the deep scleral incision, the cleft is not closed, and surgery should continue until there is no aqueous outflow. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 66-year-old man was treated for severe blunt ocular trauma of the left eye and a resultant cyclodialysis cleft, lens subluxation, choroidal detachment and a cataract. His intraocular pressure was 6 mm Hg, he presented with a shallow anterior chamber, phacodonesis, iridodonesis, 360° ciliary body detachment, and a suspicious cyclodialysis cleft in the 5 to 8 o'clock position. DIAGNOSES:: ocular blunt trauma (left eye), cyclodialysis cleft (left eye), lens subluxation (left eye), choroidal detachment (left eye), cataract (both eyes). INTERVENTIONS: The cataract was extracted by phacoemulsification and a posterior chamber intraocular lens was implanted with 2 capsular tension rings, one in the lens bag and the other in the ciliary sulcus. Throughout the following month, intraocular pressure fluctuated between 4 and 6 mm Hg and the ciliary body failed to reattach. A cyclopexy via anterior chamber perfusion was thus deemed necessary and performed. OUTCOMES: After cyclopexy, intraocular pressure increased to 27 mm Hg and decreased to 16 mm Hg after brinzolamide eye drops treatment twice daily for 4 days. Subsequently intraocular pressure stabilized between 10 to 21mm Hg. Complete closure of the cyclodialysis cleft was confirmed with ultrasound biomicroscopy. LESSONS: Cyclopexy via anterior chamber perfusion for patients with cyclodialysis cleft is a simple, safe, and efficient technique that ensures a successful surgery.
28399936	Transient bilateral cataract during intensive glucose control: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Cataracts are generally known to occur in hyperglycemic conditions in diabetic patients. In this case, cataract occurred in the course of glucose level control in a patient who had been in a hyperglycemic state. CASE PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old Korean man who had uncontrolled diabetes for more than a year presented with bilateral posterior subcapsular cataracts, which developed within days of initiating antihyperglycemic therapy. With control of his serum glucose level for several weeks, the cataracts regressed. CONCLUSIONS: Transient cataracts can develop during the hypoglycemic state; prompt surgery should be deferred.
28288588	Siderotic cataract with no signs of intraocular foreign body.	BACKGROUND: Ocular siderosis is a clinical condition induced by deposition of an iron-containing intraocular foreign body. We report a unique case of histopathologically proven lens siderosis in a young woman with a preceding history of trauma but no signs of retained intraocular foreign body. CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old woman presented with an opacified lens showing brownish deposits on the anterior capsule and underwent cataract surgery. Preoperative ophthalmic examination did not show any retained intraocular foreign body. Histopathologic staining of the anterior capsule confirmed the presence of iron deposits and macrophages. Electroretinography examination performed in the postoperative period showed the changes characteristic of retinal degeneration in ocular siderosis. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the importance of close monitoring of patients with a history of trauma or previous penetrating injury to the eye, even if there is no intraocular foreign body, because they might develop ocular siderosis at a later stage. This case report underscores the importance of electroretinography and histopathologic analysis, in addition to ophthalmic examination, in the diagnosis of ocular siderosis.
27881591	Vernal keratoconjunctivitis: culmination of management using immunosuppression, surgical and prosthetic therapy over quarter century.	A 22-year-old male patient presented in 1988 with active vernal keratoconjunctivitis. He was treated with topical mast cell stabilisers and corticosteroids. Chronic inflammation despite topical treatment necessitated oral immunosuppressants. Active disease came under control with this; however, the patient gradually developed limbal stem cell deficiency. He underwent bilateral pannus resection with amniotic membrane transplantation that resulted in improved ocular surface. In 2007, patient was found to have significant bilateral posterior subcapsular cataracts and underwent bilateral cataract surgery with intraocular lens implantation with good visual outcome. In 2016, he was provided with scleral lens prosthetic device, which further improved vision. At last follow-up, more than 25 years after his initial visit, his visual acuity was 20/25 in both eyes with a stable surface. With a comprehensive approach using immunosuppression, surgical therapy and scleral lens prosthetic device, chronic vernal keratoconjunctivitis can be well managed as illustrated in this case.
27221689	A case of perforating injury of eyeball and traumatic cataract caused by acupuncture.	Perforating globe injury is the leading cause of monocular blindness and vision loss. A 58-year-old male was injured by acupuncture needle during acupuncture treatment for his cerebral infarction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of perforating injury of the eyeball and traumatic cataract caused by acupuncture. The patient was hospitalized due to diagnosis of perforating ocular injury, traumatic cataract, and corneal and iris perforating injury. Moreover, he had to accept treatments of phacoemulsification, anterior vitrectomy along with intraocular lens implantation in the sulcus to improve his visual acuity. As acupuncture therapy has been widely performed for various diseases and achieved highly approval, the aim of this report is to remind acupuncturists operating accurately to avoid unnecessary injury during the treatment process, or the cure can also become the weapon.
26698204	Outcome of cataract surgery following simple limbal epithelial transplantation for lime injury-induced limbal stem cell deficiency.	A 19-year-old woman presented to us after being diagnosed elsewhere with right eye total limbal stem cell deficiency resulting from a lime burn. She was advised to undergo limbal stem cell transplantation, but failed to immediately do so. Two years later, she underwent cultivated limbal epithelial transplantation (CLET). As she had severe loss of vision with persisting conjunctival nodule and symblepharon 2 years following surgery, an impression of failed CLET was formed. Subsequently, simple limbal epithelial transplantation (SLET) was performed. Nine months later, she developed a cataract in her right eye; the cataract was extracted and posterior chamber intraocular lens implanted. The unaided visual acuity improved from light perception at presentation to 20/60 at 1-week postoperatively. At 5 months follow-up, the patient continued to maintain 20/60 visual acuity in her right eye. This case describes the outcome of cataract surgery following SLET, emphasising the need to perform cataract surgery in complicated cataracts for a better visual prognosis.
26530398	Bilateral cataracts in a 6-yr-old with new onset diabetes: a novel presentation of a known INS gene mutation.	The prevalence of diabetes-related cataracts during childhood is less than 1%. When cataracts occur, it is often in adolescent females with prolonged symptoms and significant hyperglycemia. Cataracts are not a classic feature of monogenic diabetes. We report a case of a 6-yr-old, previously healthy Caucasian male, who presented with bilateral acquired cataracts and was subsequently diagnosed with new onset diabetes. Additional symptoms at presentation included a several year history of polyuria and polydipsia, mild hepatomegaly, and short stature. Pertinent negatives include acanthosis nigricans, lipoatrophy, deafness, muscle weakness, or neuropathy. HbA1c was significantly elevated at diagnosis (>14%, 129.5 mmol/mol) without evidence of ketosis. Autoantibody testing was negative. Features of Mauriac syndrome (short stature, hepatomegaly) as well as acquired cataracts indicated long-standing hyperglycemia with sufficient insulin production to prevent ketone production and development of diabetic ketoacidosis. Whole exome sequencing was conducted and a de novo heterozygous mutation in the INS gene (c.94G>A; p.Gly32Ser) was identified. INS gene mutations are common causes of permanent neonatal diabetes but rare causes of antibody-negative diabetes in children. Importantly, INS gene mutations have not been previously associated with acquired cataracts. Knowledge of a monogenic cause of diabetes allows clinicians to tailor counseling and screening of diabetes-related comorbidities. In summary, this case highlights the need to consider testing for monogenic diabetes, specifically INS gene mutations, in pediatric patients with antibody-negative diabetes, especially if complications of prolonged hyperglycemia are present at diagnosis.
25228677	Anterior capsular defect with acute anterior subcapsular cataract in herpetic keratouveitis.	A 20-year-old man presented with a recurrent episode of herpetic keratouveitis in his right eye. The patient was treated with oral acyclovir and topical steroids. One week later the patient reported a sudden diminution of vision. Slitlamp biomicroscopy revealed the presence of a central anterior capsular defect and anterior subcapsular cataract. Dosage of steroids was temporarily increased and progression of cataract monitored. Subsequently, the anterior chamber reaction decreased and steroids were tapered.
23275218	Bilateral Descemet's membrane detachment after uneventful phacoemulsification in a case of diabetes mellitus.	We report a diabetic patient with bilateral Descemet's membrane (DM) detachment after successive phacoemulsification. The DM detachments were diagnosed and documented in early postoperative period using anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT) and managed successfully by descemetopexy using 14% C3F8. This case highlights that some patients may be anatomically predisposed to DM detachment. Careful preoperative examination including specular microscopy should be done preoperatively especially in diabetic patients.
23248546	Successful visual rehabilitation in a case of anterior megalophthalmos.	We report a case of 40-year-old female who presented with diminution of vision in both eyes. Ocular evaluation showed presence of bilateral megalocornea with deep anterior chamber, iridodonesis, cataract, and anterior embryotoxon. She was diagnosed with bilateral anterior megalophthalmos. She underwent an uneventful cataract extraction with standard posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation of overall large diameter in the left eye. Zonular dialysis was not evident intraoperatively despite the presence of iridodonesis. Postoperatively the intraocular lens was well centered throughout follow up. This case report reviews this rare disorder and highlights successful visual rehabilitation.
23202404	Cataract surgery after Descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty.	Management of endothelial dysfunction in phakic patients is sometimes a dilemma for corneal surgeons. Phakic patients with visually significant cataract and endothelial dysfunction are preferably managed by performing combined cataract surgery with endothelial keratoplasty. However, combined surgery may be deferred in eyes with early incipient cataract, younger age and where anterior chamber is poorly visualized. As cataract formation may be accelerated after endothelial keratoplasty, these eyes may need cataract surgery subsequently. Surgical intervention in eyes with endothelial keratoplasty is of concern as this may affect the graft adversely and threaten graft survival. In this report, we describe the intraoperative surgical details and postoperative clinical course of a patient who underwent phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation after Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK).
23202403	Endothelial cell study in a case of Werner's syndrome undergoing phacoemulsification and Yettrium-Aluminum-Garnet laser capsulotomy.	Werner's syndrome (WS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with multisystem manifestations of premature aging from the second decade of life. Cataract is one of the features of WS. Cataract surgery is complicated with postoperative wound dehiscence and bullous keratopathy when the surgery is done by intracapsular or conventional extracapsular method. We report the short-term result of phacoemulsification and Neodymimum Yettrium-Aluminum-Garnet laser (Nd YAG) capsulotomy in a case of WS with bilateral cataracts. Postoperatively and post capsulotomy, there was no change in the endothelial cell morphology. There was an 8.6% decrease in endothelial cell count at the end of 15 months postoperatively and 11 months post YAG capsulotomy. This decrease is within the acceptable range of cell loss after phacoemulsification and YAG capsulotomy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of YAG laser capsulotomy in WS.
