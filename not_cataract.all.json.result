title: Double balloon enteroscopy in the detection and removal of jejunal anisakiasis: Case report.
abstract: A 53-year-old Japanese man presented to the emergency department with epigastric pain and bloating. Computed tomography revealed a thickening of the jejunal wall and proximal dilation. Double-balloon enteroscopy was performed to investigate the jejunal thickening, which revealed an anisakis larva in the jejunum with an associated ulcer. The larva was removed using endoscopic forceps, after which there was immediate improvement of symptoms. Further patient interview determined that he had consumed marinated mackerel the day before the onset of symptoms. After diagnosis of small intestinal anisakiasis, he was successfully treated using double-balloon enteroscopy. Its use for small intestinal anisakiasis is rare, and this case may be the first instance in the jejunum. Removal of the anisakis larva led to a clear diagnosis and a quick resolution of symptoms. A history of raw fish consumption a few days before the onset of abdominal symptoms and abnormal findings on computed tomography scans are key to the diagnosis of small intestinal anisakiasis. Double-balloon enteroscopy was thought to be a safe means of making accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment of our patients.

title: A major pain in the hip - Destruction of the left acetabulum and femoral head secondary to Tuberculosis: A case report and review of the literature.
abstract: A 68-year-old-gentleman presented with left hip pain, night sweats, fatigue, and weight loss. He had previously experienced pain with white discharge until he underwent an arthroscopic washout and reduction. The left lower limb was shortened and wasted with limited hip movements. He had recently travelled to Zambia, his country of origin. Imaging demonstrated a large mass with chronic erosions of the acetabulum and femoral head. Synovial biopsy grew <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, which was treated with rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for 2 months then 4 months of rifampicin and isoniazid. Whole genome sequencing indicated full sensitivity. Complex reconstructive surgery is scheduled, with a custom femoral head and acetabulum. This case illustrates the importance of considering tuberculosis in patients with erosive joint pathology and a multidisciplinary approach as delayed diagnosis results in high morbidity. Prompt diagnosis using newer modalities such as whole genome sequencing on synovial fluid can enable timely treatment.

title: Psychosis secondary to COVID-19 in pediatric sickle cell disease.
abstract: KEY CLINICAL MESSAGE: COVID-19 psychosis is a potential long-term sequela of COVID-19. Vulnerable populations, such as individuals with sickle cell disease, are at high risk for psychosis. Given the limited number of cases, more investigations in the etiopathology and management of this new disease is needed. ABSTRACT: We report a case of a 15-year-old female with a past medical history of depression who developed psychosis post-SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19). After an initial moderate COVID-19 infection, the patient appeared to recover and was discharged home. Four weeks later, she presented with symptoms of psychosis and symptoms of cognitive impairment. Imaging studies did not show any evidence of stroke and toxicology studies were negative. She was treated with antipsychotics and required inpatient neuropsychiatric rehabilitation. Acute psychotic syndrome resolved after 3 weeks, antipsychotics were weaned, and an antidepressant was initiated. Mild cognitive impairment with significant memory loss persisted for about 1 year. Thereafter, she returned to her baseline but remains on an antidepressant. Some studies have previously reported the occurrence of psychosis in individuals with COVID-19. This report is the first outline of severe prolonged post-COVID-19 psychosis in a child with sickle cell disease. Given the neurologic vulnerability of children with sickle cell disease, these individuals should be monitored for neuropsychiatric symptoms post COVID-19.

title: Descending aorta to right atrial fistula: Transcatheter embolization of a very rare anomaly with coils.
abstract: KEY CLINICAL MESSAGE: Descending aorta to right atrial (RA) fistula is a rare and distinct clinical entity mimicking patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and it may lead to rapid development of pulmonary vascular disease. Correct diagnosis and treatment, especially in the presence of other congenital heart defects, is very important. Interventional management is the treatment of choice. ABSTRACT: We present a case report of a trisomy 21 infant with atrial and ventricular septal defects and small patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) complicated by the presence of descending aorta to right atrial (RA) fistula with large left to right shunt leading to rapid increase in pulmonary vascular resistance. Transcatheter occlusion of the fistula followed by closure of the PDA with Nit-Occlud coil systems led to decreased pulmonary pressure and resistance permitting successful surgical repair of the patient's intracardiac defects with good outcome over 3 years of follow-up. Descending aorta to RA fistula is a rare and distinct clinical entity mimicking PDA and its correct diagnosis and treatment, especially in the presence of other congenital heart defects, is very important as it may lead to rapid development of pulmonary vascular disease.

abstract: Thyroid storm represents a critical and life-threatening complication from hyperthyroidism, with a notable mortality risk. Limited literature reports have explored the correlation between thyroid storm and peri-myocarditis, although the precise pathophysiological underpinnings remain unclear. The pathophysiology of how thyroid storm and peri-myocarditis are associated is not clearly understood; however, unfavorable prognostic factors include atrial fibrillation and recurrent thyrotoxicosis. Here, we present a case concerning recurrent peri-myocarditis concomitant with a thyroid storm.

title: Case report: Retroperitoneal solid pseudopapillary neoplasm associated with multiple hepatic metastases.
abstract: Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) is a rare tumor mostly occurring in the pancreas. They are low-grade malignant tumors of the exocrine pancreas that occasionally metastasize, usually to the liver or peritoneum. Additionally, multiple metastases of extrapancreatic SPN to the liver are extremely rare and have been reported before. This study presents a case of a 13-year-old male patient with retroperitoneal SPN and multiple hepatic metastases. The patient presented with abdominal trauma and underwent enhanced CT, which revealed upper pancreatic occupancy and three hypodense foci in the right lobe of the liver. Moreover, increased spleen size was noted. The patient's serum tumor marker CA125 was increased to 39.00 U/mL (<i>N</i> < 35.0 U/mL), and circulating tumor cells were elevated to 10.2 FU/3 mL (<i>N</i> < 8.7 FU/3 mL). The patient underwent retroperitoneal occupancy resection and splenectomy, followed by resection of liver metastases 7 months after the surgery. Furthermore, multiple liver metastases from retroperitoneal SPN were confirmed postoperatively. The patient recovered for 1 year without tumor recurrence. This case emphasizes the importance of evaluating serum tumor markers and medical imaging in young patients as well as the fact that surgery appears to be the preferred treatment option for multiple metastases in SPN.

title: Monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance: An atypical presentation of Waldenström's disease.
abstract: Waldenström's disease is a rare lymphoproliferative syndrome in the bone marrow and sometimes in lymphoid organs which secretes high amounts of monoclonal immunoglobulin M into serum. It can remain indolent for years and rarely affects the kidney, with intraglomerular rather than intratubular damage being predominant, in contrast to multiple myeloma. Different studies identified AL amyloidosis as the most frequent renal lesion, followed by cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis. Signs and symptoms may be unspecific, as well as renal manifestations, so collaboration between nephrologists, hematologists, and pathologists is crucial to establish the role of paraprotein in the development of renal damage. We present an atypical case of Waldenström's disease that had a minimal monoclonal peak and clinically debuted with nephritic and nephrotic syndromes. The diagnosis was cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis. Currently, there are numerous treatment options, without enough evidence yet to establish a standardised treatment.

abstract: Employing percutaneous nephrolithotomy to manage a complex renal calculus has always been challenging due to the blood transfusion requirement and the frequent necessity of using multiple access tracts. We report a novel treatment modality in the case of a 65-year-old male with a complex, large-volume renal calculus who was successfully treated by vacuum-assisted miniaturized endoscopic combined intrarenal surgery using the combination of a thulium fiber laser in retrograde fashion with a holmium:YAG laser in antegrade fashion. The kidney stone was entirely cleared, and the patient fully recovered with no adverse event.

title: Monitoring of spontaneous pneumothorax using electrical impedance tomography: A case report.
abstract: Pneumothorax is an emergency in thoracic surgeries and respiratory medicine. A technique is warranted for real-time monitoring of pneumothorax at the bedside so that rapid diagnosis and timely intervention can be achieved. We report herein a case in which electrical impedance tomography (EIT) was employed at the bedside to monitor lung ventilation of a patient with spontaneous pneumothorax during treatment. It was found that the affected side/healthy side ventilation ratio and global inhomogeneity were strongly correlated with the severity of pneumothorax. The use of EIT allowed intuitive observation of the effect of pneumothorax on ventilation, which helped the doctors make immediate diagnosis and intervention. After timely and successful treatment, the patient was discharged. This is the first case reporting a complete therapeutic course of spontaneous pneumothorax assessed with EIT. Our case demonstrated that EIT could monitor regional ventilation loss of the affected side of pneumothorax patients at the bedside, and dynamically assess the treatment effect of pneumothorax, which provides an important imaging basis for clinical pneumothorax treatment.

title: Cutaneous Neuroendocrine Metastases of Visceral Origin Responsive to Surgical Resection and Targeted Radionuclide Therapy.
abstract: Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) encompass a diverse range of biologically and behaviorally distinct epithelial malignancies that derive from neuroendocrine cells. These neoplasms are able to secrete a variety of bioactive amines or peptide hormones. The majority of NENs are well-differentiated and are defined as neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). While NETs are known to frequently metastasize to lymph nodes, liver, and lungs, spread to the skin is extremely rare and is often a late finding. Because cutaneous metastasis from a visceral site represents distant tumor dissemination, prompt histologic diagnosis is critical in terms of selecting further treatment options and ultimately impacts subsequent prognosis. This report presents a man with painful cutaneous NET metastases initially on the face then scalp. He had a prior history of longstanding and progressive stage IV visceral disease. Multimodal therapy with initial surgical resection of the larger facial lesion and radionuclide infusion therapy was undertaken. Excision fully removed the temple lesion and resolved pain. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE, a radiolabeled somatostatin analog that targets somatostatin receptors on NETs, was given along with maintenance lanreotide therapy, which resolved the scalp lesion, prevented recurrence of prior lesions and development of new cutaneous metastases, and controlled his visceral disease. PRRT has not been previously described in the management of cutaneous NET metastases. Due to the rare nature of cutaneous NET metastases, there is no consensus regarding optimal management. As such, we propose novel multimodal therapy involving excision and targeted radionuclide therapy as a possible effective option.

abstract: Turmeric-induced liver injury is a controversial topic, and turmeric is safe to consume during pregnancy in small amounts; however, it might be an uncommon cause of liver injury if consumed in large amounts. We hereby report a case of a pregnant patient who demonstrated atypical signs and symptoms of dietary-induced liver injury during pregnancy. She presented with itching at 23 weeks 4 days of pregnancy and had deranged liver function tests and was diagnosed with dietary-induced liver injury. The patient was managed with a strict diet during the pregnancy which resulted in a significant improvement in the clinical and biochemical findings during the pregnancy.

title: Pediatric Emergency Medicine Didactics and Simulation (PEMDAS): Pediatric Sedation Complications.
abstract: INTRODUCTION: Ketamine and propofol are commonly used agents for sedation in the pediatric emergency department (PED). While these medications routinely provide safe sedations, there are side effects providers should be able to recognize and manage. Currently, no pediatric sedation simulations exist in the literature. METHODS: We created two sedation simulation cases for learners, including pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) fellows, working in the PED: case 1, a 12-year-old male with a shoulder dislocation requiring reduction under propofol sedation, and case 2, a forearm fracture requiring reduction under ketamine sedation. Learner actions included setting up equipment for sedations, dosing medications correctly, and managing complications. Additionally, in case 2, learners assigned an American Society of Anesthesiologists classification and selected the appropriate candidate for PED sedation from amongst three patients. A debrief followed the cases. Next, a didactic presentation reinforced concepts discussed in the debrief. Participants then completed an evaluation of the simulation. RESULTS: Fifty-eight emergency medicine residents and PEM fellows across four sites at three institutions participated. Participants scored the simulations and the debriefing session on a 5-point Likert scale. Learners rated the scenario as clinically relevant (<i>M</i> = 4.37) and effective at improving their comfort level in caring for critically ill patients (<i>M</i> = 4.36). Learners felt the debrief provided valuable learning (<i>M</i> = 4.40) and was a safe learning environment (<i>M</i> = 4.50). DISCUSSION: These cases can be utilized as resources for learners in any emergency department and can be tailored to any training background of learner providing sedation.

title: Extrapulmonary Tuberculosis Leading to Abdominal Wall Mass in Young Patient.
abstract: BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that is caused by <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. Tuberculosis has arguably been the largest killer of humans historically, and it remains one of the most important infectious causes of death in the world. Tuberculosis can be classified into different forms and it manifests as pulmonary and out pulmonary, respectively, in 85% and 15% of cases. Only a few cases of tuberculosis with abdominal wall involvement have been reported. <i>Case Presentation</i>. Herein, we present a 27-year-old Persian woman, presented with asymmetric abdominal bulging in the right side of the periumbilical area since 6 months before admission that has no pain or secretion. The patient was oriented and not ill or toxic in general appearance. Vital signs were within normal ranges. An abdominal physical examination revealed a mobile, well-bordered, nontender mass 3 × 3 centimeter (cm) in diameter palpated in the right periumbilical area. The patient underwent surgery which revealed a cystic lesion that was carefully resected. In histopathology examination of the specimen resection, tuberculosis was confirmed. CONCLUSION: We report a rare case of extrapulmonary tuberculosis that was identified at the abdominal wall. Due to the high number of cases of TB and the development of extrapulmonary forms that can present in an unusual location as an abdominal wall which are difficult to diagnose, it is very important to keep in mind the differential diagnosis of tuberculosis.

title: A case of chylous ascites caused by reflux from the cisterna chyli to the disrupted common iliac lymphatic vessel: fluoroscopic records during intranodal lymphangiography.
abstract: A 40-year-old woman underwent laparoscopic common iliac lymphadenectomy for metastasis from rectal cancer. Two weeks after the surgery, she was found to have massive chylous ascites. After failure of conservative treatment, bilateral inguinal intranodal lymphangiography was performed. No definite extravasation was observed while lipiodol injected through the left inguinal node was ascending. When we punctured the right inguinal lymph nodes and started the injection of lipiodol, extravasation of diluted lipiodol was noted at the level of the first sacrum. Careful observation revealed that the ascending lipiodol became diluted in the cisterna chyli, refluxed through the median paraaortic route, leaked from the excised left common iliac lymph vessel, and flowed into the abdominal cavity. Lipiodol used in lymphangiography did not reduce chylous ascites at all. Twenty-seven days after lymphangiography, laparoscopic lymphatic ligation was performed, and the chylous ascites disappeared completely. CT obtained 40 days after surgical repair revealed disappearance of ascites and enlargement of the thoracic duct, which had not been observed on preoperative lymphangiography. Notably, lymphatic reflux from the cisterna chili can occur without obstruction of the thoracic duct and may result in chylous ascites.

title: Radiological findings and endovascular management of internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysm in the setting of mucormycosis and COVID-19.
abstract: The coronavirus pandemic is now a public health emergency and has spread to nearly 206 countries across the globe. This novel disease has shaken the psycho-social, economic, and medical infrastructure of India. This has become even more challenging, considering the country's huge population. With the increase in the number of coronavirus disease (COVID) cases, our country has seen an unforeseen, unprecedented rise in a potential life and organ-threatening disease-mucormycosis. Mucormycosis is a deadly, extremely morbid, possibly life-threatening, and most feared complication of the coronavirus, caused by environmental molds belonging to the order Mucorales. Here, we report 2 cases of massive epistaxis due to internal carotid artery (ICA) pseudoaneurysm secondary to mucormycosis, post-COVID-19 pneumonia, which was managed by the endovascular route. To the best of our knowledge, there is very sparse literature available describing endovascular treatment of intracranial ICA pseudoaneurysm in a patient with COVID-induced mucormycosis.

title: A case of metastatic lymphoepithelial carcinoma of parotid gland identified on <sup>68</sup>gallium DOTA-[Tyr3] octreotate PET CT.
abstract: The authors present the case of a 59-year-old lady diagnosed with lymphoepithelial carcinoma (LEC) of the left parotid gland. The primary tumour was identified using contrast-enhanced CT, and diagnosis was confirmed via fine needle aspiration cytology and immunohistochemistry. Staging using fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET CT revealed regional nodal metastases, while no distant metastasis was evident. Following radical radiotherapy, a favourable locoregional response was observed on MRI, yet the patient's plasma Epstein-Barr virus load continued to rise. Given her primary tumour's somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2) positivity, gallium-68 DOTA-[Tyr3] octreotate PET CT (<sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTATATE PET CT) was performed, revealing multiple distant metastases with DOTATATE avidity. Despite attempts at palliative chemotherapy and immunotherapy, disease progression led to the decision for the best supportive care. The unique presentation of metastatic LEC on <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTATATE PET CT suggests a potential role for SSTR2-targeted imaging in diagnosis and management.

abstract: Congenital sigmoid colon stenosis is a rare entity that can mimic Hirschsprung disease. Presentation of congenital colon stenosis is usually within first few weeks of life. Our case presented with features of distal bowel obstruction at 2 years of age with the history of chronic constipation and progressive abdominal distention from first week of life and bilious vomiting for the last 1 week. Clinical diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease was made. Contrast enhanced CT abdomen showed bowel obstruction with transition point at the level of proximal sigmoid colon. There was a short segment stenosis at the level of proximal sigmoid colon. Contrast enema showed stenosis at proximal sigmoid colon. The bowel distal to stenosis was normal in calibre. Similar findings were seen during surgery. Mesocolon was present in stenosed segment of the bowel. The resected stenotic segment showed adequate ganglion cells in histopathology.

title: A case of low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma presented as an intramyometrial mass mimicking uterine leiomyoma on MRI.
abstract: A low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS) has a pattern of presenting as an intramyometrial mass and is often misdiagnosed as cellular leiomyoma or degenerative uterine leiomyoma. A low-grade ESS is a malignant tumour that requires total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy; while a leiomyoma is a benign tumour and could be acceptable for enucleation. As the treatment strategies differ between a low-grade ESS and leiomyoma, radiologists should be familiar with the characteristic MRI findings of a low-grade ESS. A 51-year-old woman with abnormal uterine bleeding had been observed for 2 years at a previous hospital for a uterine leiomyoma based on MRI findings. A contrast-enhanced MRI demonstrated an intramyometrial mass composed of three components with the hypointense rim on T2-weighted images (T2WI): the first component was a homogeneous solid structure with mild hyperintensity on T2WI with a low apparent diffusion coefficient value; the second component was cystic; the third component was a structure of low signal intensity on T2WI similar to the muscle. Although a degenerative uterine leiomyoma was a differential diagnosis, these MRI findings were suggestive of a low-grade ESS. A total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic lymphadenectomy, and partial omentectomy were performed. The pathological diagnosis was a low-grade ESS. In a low-grade ESS, there are three major patterns of MRI findings: one of these patterns is the less popular but clinically important intramyometrial mass pattern, which can be misdiagnosed as a leiomyoma, and this case conformed to this pattern.

title: The first case of methotrexate-associated lymphoproliferative disorder in the sacrum: a case report.
abstract: Methotrexate (MTX) is a drug used for treating rheumatoid arthritis. Recently, the reported incidence of methotrexate-associated lymphoproliferative disease (MTX-LPD) has increased, especially in Japan. Extranodal involvement is observed in half of MTX-LPD cases. However, only a few spinal lesions have been reported, with none in the sacrum. Additionally, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of MTX-LPD. Herein, we describe the case of a 74-year-old woman with MTX-LPD in the sacral spine who complained of severe back pain and nocturnal pain. Radiographs revealed a tumour on the right wing of the sacrum and a positive EBV immunoglobulin G antibody titre. MTX-LPD was suspected based on imaging findings and a history of MTX administration. A pathological examination was performed on the CT-guided biopsy specimen. The histopathological diagnosis was MTX-LPD, and MTX was discontinued. Three months after MTX administration ended, the tumour tended to shrink, and 1 year later, significant tumour shrinkage was observed. This experience suggests that MTX-LPD can be treated by discontinuing MTX administration. Therefore, early and accurate diagnosis is required, as is avoiding unnecessary treatment such as surgery. MTX-LPD should be considered, especially in spinal origin tumours in EBV-infected patients on MTX.

abstract: Classic Hodgkin lymphoma is a potentially curable disease. With the advent of effective systemic regimens with adriamycin, bleomycin, vincristine, and dacarbazine, chemotherapy has become the treatment of choice for advanced Hodgkin lymphoma. However, for advanced Hodgkin lymphoma after chemotherapy, disease relapse rates are still high. This case report highlights how low-dose palliative radiotherapy can be used successfully for the management of an unusual case of recurrent lymphoma with a different histology soon after completing systemic therapy, which was further complicated by an ongoing local infection.

title: Two cases of parathyroid carcinoma associated with multiple brown tumours.
abstract: We present two rare cases of parathyroid carcinomas associated with multiple brown tumours. Plain radiographs, computed tomography, and neck ultrasonography revealed the presence of bone and parathyroid tumours. Despite the use of 99m Tc-methoxy isobutyl isonitrile (99mTc-MIBI) or <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET)/CT, it was difficult to differentiate bone metastases from brown tumours. Parathyroid carcinoma was confirmed by histopathological examination following parathyroidectomy, resulting in spontaneous bone lesion improvement. In patients with parathyroid carcinoma presenting with bone lesions suggestive of metastasis, understanding the potential for brown tumour accumulation through 99mTc-MIBI or 18F-FDG PET/CT is pivotal. With this understanding, it is possible to diagnose brown tumours with parathyroidectomy and follow up for improvement of bone lesion and avoid invasive biopsy or surgery.

title: Antenatal diagnosis of congenital pouch colon: a case report from the Indian subcontinent with insights into management.
abstract: Congenital pouch colon (CPC) is highly uncommon congenital anorectal malformation where a distended pouch-like structure replaces either some part of the colon or the entire colon and communicates to the genitourinary tract through a fistula. Diagnosis of CPC is usually made after birth when neonate/infant presents with abdominal distension and absence of anal opening. Making antenatal diagnosis of CPC is difficult because of the lack of specific and verifiable signs on sonography. Hence, only a few cases of antenatal diagnosis of CPC have been reported.<sup>1</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>2</sup> In our case, CPC was suspected on a routine antenatal growth scan ultrasound in the late third trimester, showing a hypoechoic tubular-shaped lesion in the pre-sacral region. With this suspicion, we suggested an institutional delivery at a tertiary level centre, and diagnosis of type III CPC was confirmed on post-delivery imaging and emergency primary surgery, done on the day 3 of life (pouch resection, division of fistula, and protective colostomy). The child also underwent further corrective surgeries in a staged manner in second year of life and recovered completely. Beforehand diagnosis prevented any unnecessary delay in operative care, reduced postoperative complications, and improved the overall outcome of this otherwise complex condition.

title: Idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia of mesenteric veins: radiological evaluation using CT angiography.
abstract: A 44-year-old man presented with a chief complaint of constipation. Initial contrast-enhanced CT showed extensive bowel wall thickening, mainly in the left colon, with a thin cord-like inferior mesenteric vein (IMV), in contrast to ectatic mesenteric venous branches, suggesting bowel ischaemia owing to venous stasis. One month later, at the time of symptom exacerbation, CT angiography showed a cord-like IMV and ectatic mesenteric venous branches with early enhancement, suggesting the presence of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF). Owing to the progression of bowel ischaemia and necrosis with peritonitis, emergency surgery was performed. Surgical specimens showed focal myointimal hyperplasia of the proximal mesenteric veins in both ischaemic and non-ischaemic lesions of the resected colon, thus leading to the diagnosis of idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia of mesenteric veins (IMHMV) when combined with the clinical and imaging findings. IMHMV is a bowel ischaemic disease caused by non-thrombotic venous obstruction that requires bowel resection and has been suggested to be associated with AVF. Cord-like IMV and AVF in the mesentery are important CT findings that characterize IMHMV. CT angiography is useful in diagnosing IMHMV.

abstract: Kawasaki disease is the most common vasculitis causing acquired coronary artery aneurysm (CAA) and affects mostly children. Computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) has unique diagnostic and prognostic values in cases of giant CAA. Here, we report technical challenges encountered when performed CTCA for a case of Kawasaki disease complicated with giant CAA. In particular, there was significant flow alteration caused by the giant CAA(s) causing suboptimal enhancement when the standard protocol was applied. We share our experience in optimizing the scan and propose the use of either manual bolus tracking or test bolus technique in similar scenarios, as well as multidisciplinary approach to optimize patient preparation.

title: The dangers of "Chasing the dragon": a fatal case of heroin-induced leukoencephalopathy.
abstract: Heroin-induced leukoencephalopathy (HLE) is a rare toxic encephalopathy associated primarily with heroin inhalation, commonly referred to as "chasing the dragon." This study presents a clinical case of a 27-year-old polydrug user diagnosed with HLE during hospitalization for rapidly progressive flaccid tetraplegia and aphasia. The clinical manifestations encompassed cerebellar and bulbar dysfunction, coupled with motor impairment and altered consciousness. Based on the clinical data and MRI results, HLE was identified as the most likely cause. This article aims to provide insights into the clinical and radiological aspects of HLE, emphasizing the diagnostic significance of radiological findings. The gold standard examination for diagnosis is MRI, crucial due to the difficulties in obtaining histological confirmation for this rare condition.

title: Is arterial spin labelling necessarily low perfusion for cavernous sinus venous malformation? A case of hyperperfusion cavernous sinus venous malformation.
abstract: Generally, due to the complexity of the skull base structures, it is difficult to differentiate cavernous vascular malformation and meningioma in the cavernous sinus area using conventional imaging studies. Cavernous sinus venous malformation are characterized by increased capillary masses without a direct arterial supply, typically leading to low perfusion. On the other hand, meningiomas receive arterial blood supply to the tumour and often exhibit high perfusion. So, arterial spin labelling (ASL) can be helpful in distinguishing between the 2 tumour types. However, in our specific case of a cavernous sinus venous malformation, the ASL imaging showed hyperperfusion. Further analysis revealed that this hyperperfusion on ASL can occur when cavernous sinus venous malformation is associated with arteriovenous fistula malformation.

title: Dexamethasone Mesotherapy: An Alternative for Keloid Treatment in Hispanic Skin.
abstract: The incidence of keloids in individuals with skin of color is as high as 16%. Intralesional steroid injection is recommended as a first-line treatment, even though the outcomes are often suboptimal. Histologically, the keloid epidermal layer is thicker than in normal skin, and the vascular density is higher in the marginal area at subepidermal level due to the elevated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor. Dexamethasone significantly suppresses this proangiogenic cytokine compared with Triamcinolone. We report the case of a 32-year-old phototype VI man with a 6-month-history of a keloid on the dorsum of his right hand that caused functional and cosmetic morbidity. We performed an intralesional injection of dexamethasone using a mesotherapy technique, that led to significant shrinking and complete recovery of range of motion after two sessions, with no regrowth at the 1-year follow-up. Mesotherapy is a safe and easy technique used in cosmetic medicine, which allows for a slower diffusion of dexamethasone and prolongs its pharmacological action, reducing the risk of local side effects. This technique has the potential to be standardized, but its main drawback is the need for proper sedation. Randomized clinical trials are required to further evaluate the clinical efficacy of dexamethasone mesotherapy.

title: Endoscopic-Assisted Percutaneous Sigmoidopexy: New Highlights on Technique and Outcomes.
abstract: BACKGROUND: Sigmoid volvulus is primarily a disease of the elderly. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a case of recurrent sigmoid volvulus in an elderly woman who refused surgery due to the high risk posed by general anesthesia and surgical intervention. She underwent endoscopic-assisted percutaneous sigmoidopexy using only three 2-shot anchor sets. No radiographic observation was necessary during the procedure. Some puncture sites were secured using endoscopic clips. CONCLUSION: Endoscopic-assisted percutaneous sigmoidopexy is increasingly used as an effective alternative to surgical sigmoidopexy when surgery under general anesthesia poses a high risk. Despite clinical improvement and resolution of the recurrent volvulus, after sigmoidopexy patients may continue to experience motility dysfunction and diffuse dilation of the colon for a few weeks, which may correlate with the episodes of obstruction experienced prior to fixation.

abstract: Iliopsoas phlegmon/abscess is uncommon, and individuals often present with nonspecific symptoms. Diagnosis is often delayed and almost always requires advanced imaging techniques such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. We report a case of a 51-year-old woman who presented with right lower limb swelling and associated rash with imaging demonstrating iliopsoas abscess secondary to an infected intrauterine contraceptive device. This rare case highlights the nonspecific presentation of iliopsoas abscess and the need to consider unusual sources of infection such as an intrauterine contraceptive device in women presenting with iliopsoas phlegmon and abscess.

abstract: Intrauterine device (IUD) is considered the second most widely used method of contraception. Migration of the IUD into the urinary system has been reported. Nevertheless, a missed IUD which is mistakenly inserted into the bladder has rarely been reported. We report a female patient experienced recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) for 10 years without appropriate evaluation. The underlying problem was an IUD that inserted into the bladder led to the formation of bladder stone. The clinical course and the endoscopic management of the stone and the IUD is reviewed in this case report.

title: Double trouble: Unmasking two hook effects on Siemens Atellica® - Total PSA and total hCG assays.
abstract: The "hook effect" or "prozone phenomenon" occurs when the concentration of a particular analyte saturates the antibodies used in the test, resulting in falsely low or negative results despite the presence of high analyte concentrations. We report two recent cases of hook effect encountered with a widely used immunoassay analyzer, the Siemens Atellica® IM1600. The first case involves a patient with advanced metastatic prostate cancer whose total PSA (tPSA) concentration dropped dramatically from his last biological control. The second case concerns a pregnant woman whose total HCG (ThCG) levels were also subject to the hook effect and who was found to have a molar pregnancy. In both cases, a dilution step enabled to overcome this analytical concern and to obtain a correct result. In addition, a comparison of the sensitivity of different immunoassay analyzers to this phenomenon was carried out. To avoid this analytical error, an additional dilution step should automatically be performed when there is a clinical suspicion of elevated levels of tumor or hormone markers. Finally, the most affected manufacturers should adapt their assays, accordingly.

title: Semi-Immersive Virtual Reality Exercise Therapy for Upper Limb Rehabilitation in Patients With Spinal Cord Injury Using the Leap Motion Controller.
abstract: In this article, we present a case study involving a patient with spinal cord injury (SCI), resulting in tetraplegia and subsequent loss of upper limb function. The subject of our study was a 23-year-old woman with incomplete tetraplegia stemming from a cervical spinal cord injury. Our primary objective was to enhance hand function and grip strength. Throughout the intervention, we observed substantial enhancements in hand function, range of motion, and muscle power. Notably, the patient exhibited a favorable response to the therapy, demonstrating commendable adherence and active participation. To create an optimal training environment tailored to the patient's needs, we employed the Unity 3D game engine in conjunction with a Leap Motion controller sensor. This combination facilitated the development of a semi-immersive virtual training environment. The utilization of this technology aimed to simulate a conducive training atmosphere for the rehabilitation of hand function. Based on our study outcomes, we advocate for the incorporation of leap motion-related exercises in the treatment of hand functional loss and weakness. The promising results observed in this case study prompt the recommendation for further large-scale studies to validate and substantiate our findings. Such investigations would contribute to the establishment of evidence-based practices and enhance the understanding of the efficacy of Leap Motion technology in addressing upper limb impairments associated with spinal cord injuries.

abstract: Hypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD) is a rare form of trans-synaptic degeneration affecting the inferior olivary nucleus (ION). Its classical description involves a lesion in the Guillain-Mollaret triangle (GMT), characteristic imaging findings, and associated oculopalatal tremor. However, understanding of this disease entity is incomplete, as its overall rarity has limited strong classification. Case reports and small studies indicate that a variety of presentations can occur, including non-existent or non-classical lesions as well as variations in physical symptoms. Here we report the exceedingly rare case of idiopathic, nonlesional, unilateral HOD in a female patient.

title: Pericardial Tuberculosis in a Non-endemic Region Presenting as a Persistent Upper Respiratory Tract Infection With Negative Serology, Bronchial Washings, and Pleural Aspirate.
abstract: This paper reports on the unlikely case of a 68-year-old man presenting with a non-resolving, mild lower respiratory tract infection, subsequently diagnosed with pericardial tuberculosis (TB) in the absence of TB risk factors and with negative TB serology. Pericardial and pleural effusions were found incidentally on CT pulmonary angiogram, with a small pericardial effusion without tamponade seen on the echocardiogram. During his three-month inpatient stay, the patient was rarely very unwell, though no treatment led to clinical and biochemical resolution of symptoms. Later deterioration prompted another echocardiogram, which found a moderate-sized pericardial effusion, septal bounce, and new regional wall motion abnormalities. To avert the impending cardiac tamponade, the patient underwent pericardiectomy, which provided a tissue diagnosis of TB. Pericardial TB is extremely uncommon, especially outside of TB endemic regions, though it is well described. This case is especially noteworthy, as serology, bronchial washings, and pleural aspirate had been negative for TB though a Quantiferon test was positive. The diagnosis was only confirmed after pericardiectomy. The patient was subsequently treated with anti-TB therapy, with a good clinical response. This case highlights diagnostic challenges and strategies for investigating and managing similar complex scenarios, particularly in non-endemic settings.

title: Two Ectopic Liver Lobes Discovered Incidentally at an Autopsy: A Case Report.
abstract: The ectopic liver lobe is a rare anomaly and is most frequently reported as a solitary mass. Herein, we report a case of multiple (two) ectopic liver lobes detected at an autopsy. A Japanese man in his 70s died of an infectious disease associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Autopsy revealed the incidental finding of two 1-cm masses, located anterior to the inferior vena cava. Both masses were composed of liver tissue and had internal microscopic structures resembling the porta hepatis, consisting of an outflow bile duct and blood vessels. The outflow bile duct appeared to be continuous with the common bile duct, but the connection point of the outflow vessel was unclear. The liver tissue showed fibrous thickening of the central veins and portal venopathy, including fibrosis in the portal area as well as narrowing and loss of the portal veins. There was no evidence of congestion, fibrosis, biliary stasis, or neoplasm. The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma is higher in the ectopic liver lobe than in the proper liver, presumably due to the abnormal circulation and bile excretion pathways. The patient also presented with portal venopathy; this suggests the presence of abnormal circulatory dynamics.

title: Management of Labor and Anesthesia in a Patient With a History of Spontaneous Intracranial Hypotension: A Case Report With Literature Review.
abstract: Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is a rare disorder characterized by continuous or intermittent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage from the CSF cavity, which causes symptoms such as headache or neck pain upon standing. However, no well-established measures concerning the type of delivery and anesthesia for pregnant women with a history of SIH have been reported. A woman had developed SIH 9 years earlier from lifting luggage into an overhead bin with stretching movements, which required continuous saline epidural infusion for recovery. Upon the patient's pregnancy at the age of 35 years, although an elective cesarean section (CS) under general anesthesia was planned to avoid SIH recurrence, the patient had an emergency CS at 36 weeks. Since there is no prescribed method of delivery and anesthetic management for patients with a history of SIH, it is important to plan and adapt a treatment strategy based on the patient's wishes and the institution's protocols. As a sidenote, we reviewed the available literature regarding the type of delivery and anesthesia for pregnant women with a history of SIH.

title: Bowel Obstruction From Biliary Stent Migration: An Unusual Case of Abdominal Pain.
abstract: Endoscopic biliary stent placement is an important procedure that is commonly done in patients with malignant obstruction of the biliary tree. However, it can also be done to relieve non-maligant obstructions short term until more curative surgical interventions can be performed. There are two main types of stents used for these procedures: self-expanding metal stents (SEMSs) and plastic stents. Each of these stent types has different indications, and determining the correct stent for each individual patient is important. Here, we present a case of a 73-year-old female who presented with abdominal pain due to small bowel obstruction caused by a dislodged biliary duct stent. We hope to promote more focus on selecting the right stent type for each patient and encouraging follow-up visits after placement, especially for those with a history of medical noncompliance.

abstract: Pembrolizumab is a programmed death 1 receptor (PD-1) inhibitor. It is used as immunotherapy in various cancers, including metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and, notably, high-risk triple-negative breast cancer. We discuss a case of a 44-year-old female with a past medical history of triple-negative breast cancer who presented with a chief complaint of poor oral intake and fatigue after her fourth cycle of pembrolizumab therapy. The patient was diagnosed with pembrolizumab-induced isolated secondary adrenal insufficiency (AI) and was treated with corticosteroids with improvement in her symptoms. Secondary AI due to pembrolizumab use is a rare yet potentially life-threatening complication. If initial serum cortisol is borderline low, as observed in our patient, repeated testing within shorter intervals should be considered to optimize patient outcomes.

title: A Case of Life-Threatening Abdominal Wall Hematoma Formation in a Patient on Warfarin Therapy with Concurrent Influenza Infection.
abstract: Warfarin therapy provides extensive antithrombotic benefits and, thus, is widely used in the general population. However, as with most medications, there are also risks associated with warfarin use. Specifically, because of the narrow therapeutic window of this drug, patients taking it are at a much higher risk of accidental bleeding. Additionally, patients may also present with bleeding complications when infected with illnesses with coughing as a symptom, such as influenza or COVID-19. These patients have the potential to suffer hemorrhagic morbidities related to the increased intra-abdominal and intra-thoracic pressures that are generated from coughing. Moreover, a synergistic effect is seen when patients find themselves in a situation where they are taking anticoagulation therapy and become infected with illnesses such as influenza or COVID-19. We present a case in which an individual on warfarin therapy was infected with Influenza A. This combination of factors eventually led to massive hemorrhage and large abdominal wall hematoma formation. This case brings to light the importance of having a low threshold for considering the prospect of massive hemorrhage in any patient who is anticoagulated and develops a condition that is associated with increased abdominal pressure. Because these bleeding events can have devastating effects, raising awareness of this risk is increasingly important. Early detection of massive hemorrhage will lead to better outcomes and can ultimately be life-saving for these patients.

title: Vasopressin-Induced Gangrene of the Bilateral Foot Digits and Right Index Finger Managed With Platelet-Rich Plasma Treatment.
abstract: Bilateral foot digit gangrene generated by vasopressin is a serious complication for which management and treatment choices are extremely difficult. This case report presents a case of vasopressin-induced gangrene that was successfully treated with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) infiltration. A 20-year-old female patient came with a history of vasopressin treatment, causing bilateral foot digit gangrene and increasing necrosis. The patient's health quickly declined, and conventional care techniques had no effect on enhancing tissue perfusion or stopping the gangrene from getting worse. In our study, we have chosen to use PRP infiltration as an experimental therapeutic technique in light of the restricted choices available. This case study demonstrates the possibility of PRP infiltration as a cutting-edge and effective treatment for vasopressin-induced bilateral foot digit gangrene. The potential of PRP to stimulate angiogenesis, tissue regeneration, and wound healing is essential for optimizing the patient's results. For vasopressin-induced gangrene, more studies are required to evaluate the efficacy of PRP infiltration as a common therapy approach. This case study highlights the important role that PRP infiltration plays in enhancing tissue perfusion, stopping the advancement of necrosis, and promoting recovery.

title: Impetigo Surgical Site Infection Following Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of a Patella Fracture.
abstract: Impetigo is a pediatric skin infection characterized by the presence of pathognomonic "honey-crusted" lesions caused by either <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>or <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>. The diagnosis of impetigo is largely based on clinical judgment, confirmatory skin cultures, and Gram staining. Surgical site infections following patellar surgery are a relatively uncommon occurrence, with the most common causative organisms being <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</i> and other gram-negative bacilli. Surgical site infections have a range of risk factors that largely depend on patient characteristics and surgical logistics. We report the first documented case in the literature of a surgical impetigo infection with diagnostic skin lesions following open reduction and internal fixation of a patellar fracture in a 24-year-old female.

title: Bilateral Total Hip Prosthesis in Coxarthritis of Inflammatory Origin: Technical Features and Intraoperative Complications Encountered in Five Cases.
abstract: Total hip arthroplasty remains the treatment of last resort in inflammatory coxarthritis, where joint destruction is bilateral as well as the treatment which must be bilateral. We present in this work the experience of our orthopaedic department with a series of five cases (10 hips) operated for total hip arthroplasty. the first particularity observed in this series is the abnormal bone fragility present in 55% of the cases. For this reason, we had two other intraoperative complications that are related to this bone fragility, during the preparation of the acetabulum, we had a destruction of the medial wall by the burr that went unnoticed intraoperatively and was discovered during the patient's recovery from acute ischemia secondary to the burr, which led to an extensive rupture of the common femoral vein and partial sectioning of the common femoral artery. We also had an exceptional incident in a case with two ankylosed hips; in fact, when the approach was performed, the sciatic nerve was found pressed against the posterior surface of the greater trochanter, which was unusual but was explained by the retraction of the structures of the gluteal region secondary to prolonged immobilization. Thus, there was one case of cement shock manifested by hypotension occurring immediately after cement placement. In front of this inflammatory disease and ankylosis terrain, the surgeon must always be prepared for any complication and must keep in mind that he is operating on a hip that is anatomically not normal due to ankylosis and retraction of the vascular, nerve, and muscle structures.

title: A Rare Case of Uterine Blastomycosis and Its Management: A Case Report and Literature Review.
abstract: The report delineates the rare occurrence of uterine blastomycosis, an atypical systemic presentation of <i>Blastomyces dermatitidis</i> infection prevalent in North America. Focused on a 51-year-old immunocompetent female displaying abdominal pain and irregular vaginal bleeding, it underscores the intricate diagnostic hurdles posed by symptoms mirroring common gynecological conditions. Despite fewer than 10 recorded cases, the rarity of uterine involvement highlights the imperative for heightened clinical suspicion. The multifaceted diagnostic strategy integrates risk factors, travel history, imaging, and histopathological examinations. Emphasizing a multidisciplinary treatment helmed by gynecologists, pathologists, and infectious disease specialists, the utilization of antifungal agents, notably itraconazole, is pivotal. Addressing the scarcity of literature and the condition's clinical resemblance to prevalent ailments, further research becomes paramount in devising tailored diagnostic and treatment protocols for uterine blastomycosis. This study enriches the existing literature by providing critical insights into a scarcely documented condition, contributing novel perspectives essential for clinical understanding and management strategies.

title: Tracking Endometrial Malacoplakia Through the Evolution of 2D and 3D Ultrasound and Histopathological Features.
abstract: Malacoplakia is an uncommon disease characterized by chronic and granulomatous inflammation, which rarely involves the female genital tract. We describe the ecographic and histological evolution of the first case of a patient developing endometrial malacoplakia as a complication after a cesarean section. The patient, a 43-year-old woman, presented with pelvic pain one month after delivering by cesarean section and the initial suspicion was of retention of placental rests. We discuss the diagnostic challenges for this rare disease, highlighting the importance of considering endometrial malacoplakia as a possible diagnosis in patients with similar clinical presentations and the important role of 2D and 3D ultrasound in the diagnostic pathway. In literature, ultrasound findings in cases of endometrial malacoplakia are represented by hypoechoic thickening of the endometrial lining; hyperechoic thickening of the myometrium, and the presence of masses, nodules, cystic areas, or anechoic fluid within the endometrium. For the first time, we describe the evolution of endometrial malacoplakia through both ultrasound, 2D and 3D, and histopathological findings, from the acute to chronic stage of the disease.

Most of these perforations are single. Literature has revealed only one case of multiple small bowel diverticular perforations. We report the first case of simultaneous perforation of four jejunal diverticulae in an 85-year-old male. Small bowel resection and primary anastomosis were performed. The patient had an uneventful post-operative recovery. This case highlights the importance of prompt diagnosis and timely management to reduce the morbidity and mortality of these patients. It should be included in the differential diagnosis in all elderly patients presenting with acute abdomen.

title: Successful Treatment of Chronic Actinic Dermatitis with Tofacitinib.
abstract: We present the case of a 58-year-old male patient who presented with pruritic skin plaques and papules on the scalp, face, back, and back of the hands for over a year. The symptoms worsened upon exposure to sunlight and improved on cloudy days. Despite previous attempts at treatment with glucocorticoid ointment and antihistamine drugs, the patient experienced progressive aggravation of symptoms. Physical examination revealed hypertrophic and infiltrating nodules, with significant scratches and local exudation. Skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of sun-induced dermatosis. The patient was initiated on tofacitinib, an oral Janus Kinase inhibitor, along with a halometasone ointment, oral ebastine tablets, and strict sun protection. Over the course of four revisits spanning four months, the patient experienced a significant improvement in symptoms, with the rash almost disappearing and pruritus subsiding. The treatment was well tolerated and no adverse effects were observed. Follow-up for six months post-treatment showed no recurrence of symptoms. This case highlights the efficacy of tofacitinib in managing sun-induced pruritic plaques and suggests it as a potential therapeutic option in similar cases.

title: Stafne's Bone Defect Correlated with Submandibular Glands: A Case Report and CBCT and MRI Analysis.
abstract: Stafne's bone defect is a developmental anatomic bone defect in the lingual side of the mandible in the area of the mandibular angle that is filled with proliferation or translocation of adjacent structures such as salivary gland tissue. The etiology is still undefined, and two hypotheses are proposed: one is the glandular related to the submandibular or sublingual glands and the second is ischemic that affects the vascularization of the mandibular lingual. Usually, Stafne's bone defect is accidentally detected on panoramic radiographs during dental treatments as a well-limited radiolucency image with a clear peripheral regular condensation border, located below the mandibular canal. The differential diagnosis includes traumatic bone cyst, odontogenic and nonodontogenic cystic lesions, nonossifying fibroma, focal osteoporotic bone marrow defect, and other lesions. A case of Stafne's bone defect on a 60-year-old male patient extending in the lingual posterior part of the mandibular region was presented. The panoramic radiograph revealed a well-limited radiolucency image with a clear peripheral regular condensation border, located below the mandibular canal. The lesion was discovered in a routine radiographic exam: the cone beam computed tomography gave us more details about the localization, the shape and size, and the relation with the mandibular canal, and the magnetic resonance imaging identifies the nature of the inside soft tissue. The final diagnosis was a Stafne's bone defect resulting of a depression of the lingual cortical plate filled with expansion of the submandibular gland.

The study included three cases of cloaca with associated hydrocolpos that were operated during the period 2022 through 2023. The patient is placed in the prone position for a standard posterior sagittal anorectoplasty. The distal rectal fistula is severed flush with the vagina/sinus leaving an open defect in the posterior wall of the vagina/sinus. The defect is then widened distally via a vertical incision (∼1 cm) through the posterior wall of the common urogenital sinus toward but not reaching the perineum. This vertical defect is then closed horizontally displacing the posterior vaginal wall downwards toward the perineum (posterior sinuplasty). The postoperative recovery was uneventful in the three cases. Adequate drainage of hydrocolpos was confirmed by imaging at follow-up, as well as improvement of upper urinary tract dilatation. In selected cases of cloaca, posterior sinuplasty is a simple procedure that can be applied during anorectoplasty to provide effective drainage of associated hydrocolpos.

title: A case of hot tub lung secondary to mycobacterium avium complex in Victoria, Australia.
abstract: Hot tub lung (HTL) is a type of Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (HP) caused by inhalation of aerosols containing non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). We report the first case of hot tub lung in Victoria, Australia. A 31-year-old female presented with 3 weeks of dyspnoea, fevers and malaise, despite a course of antibiotics. She had used an indoor spa frequently for the past several months. She was hypoxic saturating 86% on room air. Examination revealed fine bilateral basal crepitations without wheeze. Inflammatory markers were elevated. A high resolution CT (HRCT) chest demonstrated extensive bilateral ground glass changes and centrilobular nodular opacities involving upper and lower zones. Bronchial washings were obtained and isolated Mycobacterium Avium Complex. Clinically, the patient had excellent response to empirical corticosteroids and avoidance of hot tub. This case highlights the importance of clinical history taking and suspicion of Hot Tub Lung as a differential diagnosis in a patient with a compatible clinical history, radiology and microbiology and exposure to a hot tub.

title: A case of allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis: 3D-CT Findings led to successful multidisciplinary treatment with dupilumab and cryoprobe.
abstract: The present case involved a 78-year-old woman with repeated recurrences of allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis (ABPM) who presented to our outpatient clinic with a chief complaint of dyspnoea with respiratory failure. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed atelectasis of the lower lobes due to mucus plugs. Blood and biochemical tests showed a high peripheral blood eosinophil count (1330/μL) and elevated immunoglobulin E (15,041 IU/mL; normal, < 361 IU/mL). Recurrent ABPM was diagnosed. The patient also showed chronic lower respiratory tract infection associated with <i>Mycobacterium avium</i> complex and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. First, we removed the mucus plug with a cryoprobe to avoid administering corticosteroids. However, subsequent 3-dimensional CT showed residual mucus plugs, so we administered dupilumab as an additional treatment. After initiating dupilumab, mucus plugs disappeared and respiratory failure resolved. We were able to implement multidisciplinary treatment that did not rely on corticosteroids.

title: Extramural recurrence of tracheal glomus tumour following resection by rigid bronchoscopy.
abstract: Glomus tumour of the trachea is very rare neoplasm that is generally benign and arises most commonly from the distal portion of the respiratory tree. This report presents the case of a 67-year-old man who was referred to our institute for excision of a tracheal mass that had been found incidentally, and subsequently recurred extramurally. Initial contrast-enhanced computed tomography images of the chest revealed a nodular lesion in the trachea, 2.5 cm above the carina, that demonstrated strong enhancement similar to blood vessels. The tumour was excised by rigid bronchoscopy, but an extramural tracheal lesion was detected 18 months later. Tracheal resection and end-to-end anastomosis were performed, and histopathological examination confirmed the extramural lesion as recurrence of the tracheal glomus tumour. The histologic features and treatment are discussed.

title: Targeting yeast topoisomerase II by imidazo and triazoloacridinone derivatives resulting in their antifungal activity.
abstract: Fungal pathogens are considered as serious factors for deadly diseases and are a case of medical concern. Invasive fungal infections also complicate the clinical course of COVID-19, leading to a significant increase in mortality. Furthermore, fungal strains' multidrug resistance has increased the demand for antifungals with a different mechanism of action. The present study aimed to identify antifungal compounds targeting yeast topoisomerase II (yTOPOII) derived from well-known human topoisomerase II (hTOPOII) poisons C-1305 and C-1311. Two sets of derivatives: triazoloacridinones (IKE1-8) and imidazoacridinones (IKE9-14) were synthetized and evaluated with a specific emphasis on the molecular mechanism of action. Our results indicated that their effectiveness as enzyme inhibitors was not solely due to intercalation ability but also as a result of influence on catalytic activity by the formation of covalent complexes between plasmid DNA and yTOPOII. Lysine conjunction increased the strength of the compound's interaction with DNA and improved penetration into the fungal cells. Triazoloacridinone derivatives in contrast to starting compound C-1305 exhibited moderate antifungal activity and at least twice lower cytotoxicity. Importantly, compounds (IKE5-8) were not substrates for multidrug ABC transporters whereas a derivative conjugated with lysine (IKE7), showed the ability to overcome C. glabrata fluconazole-resistance (MIC 32-64 µg mL<sup>-1</sup>).

title: Pediatric spinal ependymoma with chromothripsis of chromosome 6: a case report and review of the literature.
abstract: BACKGROUND: Ependymomas are the third most common central nervous system tumor in the pediatric population; however, spinal ependymomas in children are rare. Ependymomas affecting the spinal cord most frequently occur in adults of 20-40 years of age. The current World Health Organization classification system for ependymomas is now composed of ten different entities based on histopathology, location, and molecular studies, with evidence that the new classification system more accurately predicts clinical outcomes. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 16-year-old Caucasian female patient with a history of type 2 neurofibromatosis with multiple schwannomas, meningioma, and spinal ependymoma. Chromosome analysis of the harvested spinal ependymoma tumor sample revealed a 46,XX,-6,+7,-22,+mar[16]/46,XX[4] karyotype. Subsequent OncoScan microarray analysis of the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor sample confirmed + 7, -22 and clarified that the marker chromosome represents chromothripsis of the entire chromosome 6 with more than 100 breakpoints. Fluorescent in situ hybridization and microarray analysis showed no evidence of MYCN amplification. The final integrated pathology diagnosis was spinal ependymoma (central nervous system World Health Organization grade 2 with no MYCN amplification. CONCLUSION: This case adds to the existing literature of pediatric patients with spinal ependymomas and expands the cytogenetic findings that may be seen in patients with this tumor type. This case also highlights the value of cytogenetics and microarray analysis in solid tumors to provide a more accurate molecular diagnosis.

title: Molecular diagnosis of Taenia saginata from two patients in Palestine: two case reports.
abstract: BACKGROUND: Taeniasis, is a worldwide foodborne zoonotic disease caused by two principal species; Taenia saginata and Taenia solium. The tapeworm infects the intestine causing taeniasis in humans. Taeniasis is a very rare parasitic infection in Palestine with very few annual cases of unknown species. The infection rate and the disease status are not clear due to the lack of reports about the actual number of patients. CASE PRESENTATION: Two Palestinian patients; one male of 22 years old from Hebron and the other is female of 33 years old from Ramallah were referred to Palestinian Health Services in the West Bank, Palestine, complained of weight loss, abdominal pain and presence of motile segments of creamy color in the their stool. Microscopic analysis of the stool samples from infected cases revealed Taenia eggs and proglottids, confirmed taeniasis infection. The parasite species was identified as T. saginata by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing of the cytochrome oxidase -1 (COX-1) gene. CONCLUSION: Taeniasis is an unusual parasitic infection in Palestine, there is a growing concern that the actual numbers of infected individuals are much higher and the occurrence of human taeniasis is principally due to people's eating habits in consumption of raw or undercooked beef meat. This report highlighted for the first time the existence of taeniasis infection in the country; which necessitates the need to conduct further research and surveillance to reveal the actual infection rate and the available Taenia species.

title: 'Skip' osteoporosis vertebral compression fractures caused by electrical injury: a case report and review of the literature.
abstract: INTRODUCTION: Electrical injuries rarely result in fractures, such as long bone fractures and spinal fractures. A few articles have reported osteoporosis vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) caused by electrical injuries. Here, we present a rare case of 37-year-old male suffering from the 9th thoracic (T9) and 5th lumbar (L5) OVCFs after receiving a electric shock. CASE PRESENTATION: A 37-year-old Han male experienced an electric shock (480 V direct current) at the working time and felt immediately serious back pain. He did not fall and lose consciousness. X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging showed acute OVCFs, as well as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry indicated osteoporosis. Normal laboratory tests can avoid secondary osteoporosis resulting from metabolic diseases and tumors. Finally, he was diagnosed with acute discontinuous OVCFs (T9 and L5). The patient denied having a history of back pain, whereas, he had a history of smoking, alcohol abuse, and congenital heart disease (tetralogy of Fallot) were associated with osteoporosis. Considering no local kyphosis and < 50% anterior body compression, we selected conservative treatment for this patient. At a 1-year and 3-year follow-up, the lateral thoracic and lumbar radiography demonstrated no instability of the spine, and the back pain has been relieved. CONCLUSIONS: This rare case reminds us the importance of consulting a detailed medical history when we encounter young patients receiving electrical injuries. Discontinuously OVCFs must not be overlooked, even though we encounter a young man.

abstract: BACKGROUND: Scleredema adultorum of Buschke is a rare disease characterized by firm and non-pitting edema of the skin. The condition is rare with unknown etiology. Diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical findings and skin biopsy. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we describe a 14-year-old Iranian girl presenting with non-pitting edema and woody thickening of the skin that progressed within a month. She was evaluated for possible underlying malignancy or connective tissue disorders, which were excluded by multiple laboratory workups. She underwent a skin biopsy which confirmed the diagnosis of scleredema, and she was successfully treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and mycophenolate mofetil. CONCLUSION: While scleredema adultorum of Buschke is a rare disease with no definite treatment, our effort through this report was to highlight the possible benefits of treatment by intravenous immunoglobulin and mycophenolate mofetil.

title: Exploration of genetic characterization in hyperprogressive disease after immunotherapy retreatment in a patient with LCNEC: A case report.
abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic option for large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC). However, various studies have suggested a potential risk of hyperprogressive disease (HPD) in patients receiving ICI, which might be associated with gene alterations. Here, this is the first report on an unknown primary LCNEC patient who had achieved a long-term response from ICI treatment (atezolizumab), but developed HPD after tumor progression due to receiving another ICI agent (serplulimab). The mutation region of FAT4, SMARCA4, CYLD, CTNNB1, and KIT was altered prior to serplulimab treatment compared to before atezolizumab treatment. This case suggested a potential association between these mutated genes and HPD. Patients with the aforementioned genes should caution when selecting ICI treatment. These findings required further confirmation in a larger study cohort.

title: Clozapine-Induced Severe Toxicity: Exploring the Pharmacokinetic Profile of Clozapine and Its Significance in Hemodynamic Instability - A Case Report.
abstract: Hemodynamic instability in patients with clozapine intoxication can indirectly reflect the serum concentration of clozapine.We have described a case of a 32-year-old pregnant woman who developed life-threatening clozapine toxicity at 28 weeks of gestation. The levels of clozapine and norclozapine in the serum were high. We initiated hemoperfusion(HP) and other detoxification therapies to remove the drug. The patient had severely dilated peripheral blood vessels, which led to cardiac symptoms such as fatal hypotension and uncontrollable tachycardia, resulting in very high cardiac output and elevated Central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2). Pharmacological intervention significantly improved the hemodynamics.In light of our observations in the ongoing case, we posit that evaluating hemodynamic parameters before and after blood detoxification could serve as a valuable means to gauge effectiveness and provide guidance for treatment.

title: A family case report of parathyroid carcinoma associated with <i>CDC73</i> mutation in hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome.
abstract: BACKGROUND: Hereditary primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) accounts for 5-10% of all PHPT cases, necessitating genetic testing for diagnosis and management. Among these, hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome (HPT-JT) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by <i>CDC73</i> mutations with variable clinical presentations and incomplete symptoms. CASE SUMMARY: The proband, diagnosed with PHPT, underwent parathyroidectomy at the age of 41 with pathological examination of parathyroid carcinoma (PC). Hereditary PHPT was initially suspected due to the early-onset PHPT and family history. Genetic testing identified a heterozygous <i>CDC73</i> mutation, NM_024529.4: c. 687_688delAG (p. Arg229Serfs*37). Even in the absence of jaw tumors, the diagnosis of HPT-JT was confirmed based on the discovery of renal cysts. A secondary thyroidectomy was performed to reduce the risk of recurrence. CONCLUSION: Genetic testing is strongly recommended in cases of early-onset PHPT, family history, jaw tumors, renal and uterine involvement, atypical parathyroid tumors, and PC. This testing provides valuable information for personalized management, and counseling is available for affected families.

abstract: An 82-year-old man with Philadelphia chromosome-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) complicated by hepatocarcinoma was presented. Remission induction therapy of hyper-CVAD with half dose reduction achieved hematological complete remission (CR), but accompanied with elevated alanine aminotransferase and hyperbilirubinemia. The patient was thought intolerable for hyper-CVAD with half dose reduction due to liver toxicity, and treatment was switched to blinatumomab. Hematological CR was sustained after nine cycles of blinatumomab without exacerbation of liver dysfunction. After five courses of blinatumomab, hepatocarcinoma was treated successfully by trans-arterial chemoembolization. Two years after the diagnosis of ALL, the patient was alive in CR status of ALL.

title: Two tumor types in a unilateral testis in a patient with severe oligozoospermia and a history of cryptorchidism surgery: A case report.
abstract: Testicular cancer, the most common cancer among young male adults, is associated with infertility. A 38-year-old male patient was admitted to Dokkyo Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Japan, with infertility associated with severe oligozoospermia. Scrotal ultrasonography revealed two distinct tumors in the left testis: A mass with abundant blood flow on the cranial side and a mass with poor blood flow on the caudal side. Additional analysis revealed mild elevation of intact human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels (tumor marker level assessment), high testosterone and low luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels (hormonal level assessment) and severe oligoasthenozoospermia (semen assessment). The preoperative diagnosis was left-sided testicular cancer and severe oligoasthenozoospermia and the patient underwent left high orchiectomy and oncological testicular sperm extraction. Based on the pathological assessment, the cranial tumor was diagnosed as a seminoma with syncytiotrophoblastic cells, whereas the caudal tumor had only scar tissue with germ cell neoplasia <i>in situ</i> in the adjacent parenchyma. Following surgery, intact hCG and hormone levels of the patient were normalized, and the semen parameters (semen volume, sperm density, and motility) improved dramatically. To the best of our knowledge, the present case is the first report of two types of testicular tumor in a unilateral testis in a patient with a history of cryptorchidism surgery. The present case demonstrated that scrotal ultrasonography should be performed in patients with abnormal semen results to rule out testicular tumors.

abstract: Multiple primary intracranial tumors, or the presence of two or more primary intracranial tumors, are a rare clinical occurrence. The current study presents the case of a 28-year-old patient with concurrent left vestibular schwannoma, left cerebellar hemisphere dermoid cyst and craniovertebral junction malformation, specifically basilar invagination and Klippel-Feil syndrome. The patient exhibited symptoms of torticollis and recurrent headaches, with no apparent hearing loss. A far lateral approach was selected for surgical resection to address these complex conditions and achieve gross total resection in a single-stage surgery while preserving both facial and auditory nerve function. Successful gross total resection was achieved and the function of both nerves was effectively preserved. Of note, the coexistence of vestibular schwannoma and dermoid cyst in the same patient has not been documented in the existing literature. The present study provided a comprehensive account of the presentation and progression of this uncommon medical scenario. Furthermore, a surgical principle for the management of multiple primary intracranial tumors was proposed.

title: Multidisciplinary treatment of advanced cervical esophageal adenocarcinoma derived from a gastric inlet patch: A case report.
abstract: A gastric inlet patch (GIP) is an ectopic gastric mucosal lesion usually arising at the cervical esophagus that may rarely cause esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of a GIP-derived EAC that was successfully treated using a multidisciplinary treatment approach. A 64-year-old man was referred to the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Kanazawa University Hospital (Kanazawa, Japan) for surgical treatment of refractory recurrent cervical EAC derived from GIP who had previously been treated with induction chemotherapy, definitive chemoradiotherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a stenotic tumor at the GIP site in the cervical esophagus and submucosal tumors with suspected multiple intramural metastases in the anal side of the thoracic esophagus. The patient underwent robot-assisted thoracoscopic esophagectomy with laryngopharyngectomy and cervical lymphadenectomy as radical salvage surgery 4 months after the last PDT procedure. After postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy using oral administration of tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil (oral 5-fluorouracil prodrug) for 1 year; at present, the patient is alive without recurrence 3 years after the operation.

title: Measuring for change/Mobile Creches.
abstract: INTRODUCTION: Research spanning decades across fields such as psychology, education, and neuroscience consistently highlights the crucial role of social-emotional skills in various aspects of personal, academic, and professional development (1-3). The fact that UNESCO recognises social-emotional learning (SEL) as essential not just for meeting its educational objectives but also for accomplishing the Sustainable Development Goals highlights the crucial role robust social-emotional development plays in establishing sustainable societies. Whilst various studies highlight the importance of SEL, there is limited attention on how organizations can contribute to building such development by consciously including SEL in their work practice. PROCESS/METHODS: Our case study presents the process of integrating SEL into organizational practice over a period of 9 months. The selected constructs of SEL were determined by the organisation's needs and values. The Measurement for Change approach was used to frame and implement the intervention, with interactive discussions being the key methodology. Data were collected via surveys, reflective sharing, and observations. RESULTS: A shift in the selected constructs of SEL was recorded, with data highlighting individual differences. CONCLUSION: The process of co-design and continual reflective practice was key to achieving change within the subset of the organisation rather than the specific content of the materials used.

title: Association of the Osseodensification Technique with Soft Tissue Substitute in a Limitrophe Edentulous Area: A Clinical Case Report with 5-Year Follow-Up.
abstract: The osseodensification (OD) technique differs from conventional milling for dental implant installation in that it preserves the prepared bone and compacts it toward the apex and lateral walls of the socket, resulting in bone compaction. By enabling autografting, bone expansion, and high implant insertion torques, OD has become an increasingly popular option. The aim of this clinical case report is to demonstrate the predictability of combining OD with guided bone and tissue regeneration (GBR/GTR) techniques for bone expansion in the maxilla with reduced thickness, while avoiding other reconstructive surgeries. The report presents the treatment of a 32-year-old female patient who had cosmetic concerns regarding the anterior maxillary region. The patient was using an adhesive prosthesis with pontic on tooth 13 fixed between teeth 12 and 14. After the case was planned, it was decided that bone expansion in the region would be performed using the OD technique. The implant installation (AR Torque, 3.5 × 11.5 mm, Conexão®) and guided bone regeneration (GBR) were done with the assistance of L-PRF (Stick Bone, associated with L-PRF membrane). Following the osseointegration period, a provisional resin crown was fabricated, and a collagen matrix membrane (Mucoderm®) was used to increase vestibular soft tissue volume and shape the patient's gingival profile. After a period of 120 days, the final crown was created and observed for a span of 5 years. The results showed stability of the case along with maintaining its esthetic and satisfactory function. The use of the osseodensification technique coupled with a connective tissue graft substitute has been anticipated for a long time. It has proven to be an excellent alternative to autogenous grafts.

RCC are slow growing and often asymptomatic, thus are often found incidentally. Here we present the case of a 76-year-old male who was found to have a metastatic RCC in a para-aortic lymph node with no primary lesion. He underwent a retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy and 15 months after the surgery, has had no signs of primary tumours or metastasis. This case reports on a rare instance of metastatic RCC without an identified primary renal malignancy.

title: Extensive Phenotypic Variability in Syndrome Dysmorphic Facies, Renal Agenesis, Ambiguous Genitalia, Microcephaly, Polydactyly, and Lissencephaly (DREAM-PL): A Case Report Highlighting Diagnostic and Management Challenges.
abstract: The dysmorphic facies, renal agenesis, ambiguous genitalia, microcephaly, polydactyly, and lissencephaly (DREAM-PL) syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by dysmorphic facies, renal agenesis, ambiguous genitalia in males, microcephaly, polydactyly, and lissencephaly. The CTU2 gene, which encodes a protein involved in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNAs is the source of the syndrome's mutation. Several developmental abnormalities can result from a disruption of this modification, which is necessary for the proper translation of genes. The severity of the symptoms of DREAM-PL syndrome can range from moderate to severe, and its clinical characteristics are quite diverse. Some patients might have some of the distinguishing characteristics, whereas others might have all of them. The most typical characteristics include ambiguous genitalia, dysmorphic facies, and microcephaly. DREAM-PL syndrome is diagnosed based on clinical signs and genetic testing which can show mutations in the CTU2 gene. Although there is no known cure for this syndrome, the treatment aims to manage the symptoms. Other lines of treatment like surgical correction of birth defects can sometimes be beneficial to these patients in addition to supportive care. This study is a report of a 37-week-old male neonate, delivered by lower segment cesarean section. The baby's birth weight is 2.760 kg with a heterozygous confirmed pathogenic mutation of the CTU2 gene confirmed by whole-exome sequencing.

title: The Efficacy of Intraoperative Esophagogastroduodenoscopy in Localizing Retroperitoneal Bowel Injury: A Case Report.
abstract: The efficacy of intraoperative esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in visualizing a patient's small bowel interior to detect injuries or lesions, or conduct a leak test post-bowel anastomosis, makes it a preferred option among surgeons. However, it is not always available, can carry a risk of morbidity and mortality, or can prolong operative time if not performed by a proficient team. A 21-year-old male patient came to the emergency department with four gunshot wounds to his abdomen, with two on either side of the abdomen. Exploratory laparotomy was performed and through and through injuries were identified in the small bowel and at the junction of the third/fourth portion of the duodenum. It was challenging to gather the patient's past medical history, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding history, due to the underlying medical condition. However, the patient had experienced a retroperitoneal bowel injury in the setting of duodenal hematoma that was not immediately identified at first glance. In this context, intraoperative endoscopy could be a significant adjunct to detect retroperitoneal bowel injury if rapidly available and in a controlled scenario. Moreover, the advantages of intraoperative EGD increase with positive collaboration between a general surgeon and a gastroenterologist.

title: Burkitt Lymphoma With Aberrant Expression of Cytoplasmic Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase: A Case Report.
abstract: This study describes a rare case of Burkitt lymphoma with aberrant expression of cytoplasmic terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). Flow cytometry demonstrated a predominantly mature B cell immunophenotype as expected for Burkitt lymphoma, however, the immature marker TdT was also expressed. Immunohistochemistry showed that TdT was localized to the cytoplasm, with absent nuclear localization. The patient received standard intensive chemotherapy for Burkitt lymphoma and has remained in remission for nine years. Pathologists should be aware of this unusual phenomenon of aberrant cytoplasmic TdT expression to avoid confusing Burkitt lymphoma with B cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma.

title: Neuralgic amyotrophy with multiple hourglass-like constrictions of anterior interosseous nerve: a case report.
abstract: Hourglass-like constrictions (HLCs) of peripheral nerves in the upper extremity were a rare form of neuralgic amyotrophy, often characterized by the sudden onset of pain in the shoulder or arm, followed by muscle weakness and amyotrophy, with limited sensory involvement. We present a case of multiple HLCs of the anterior interosseous nerve (AIN) in a 22-year-old female with left upper arm pain, finger numbness, and limited activity for 1 month. Physical examination showed weakness of the left index flexor digitorum profundus and flexor pollicis longus, with mild hypoesthesia in the first three fingers and the radial half of the ring finger. Electromyography suggested a median nerve (mainly AIN) lesion. Ultrasonographic imaging of the median nerve shows AIN bundle swelling and multiple HLCs at left upper arm. Despite conservative treatment, which included 15 days of steroid pulse therapy, Etoricoxib, and oral mecobalamin, the patient still complained of extreme pain at night without relief of any symptoms. Operation was recommended for this patient with thorough concerns of surgical advantages and disadvantages. During surgery, a total of 7 HLCs were found in her median nerve along and above the elbow joint. Only Interfascicular neurolysis was performed because the nerve constrictions were still in the early stage. The pain was almost relieved the next day. One month after surgery, she could bend her thumb and index fingers, although they were still weak. 4 months after the surgery, she was able to bend affected fingers, with muscle strength M3 level. At the same time, her fingers had fewer numbness symptoms. There was still controversy regarding treatment strategy; however, early diagnosis and surgical treatment for nerve HLCs might be a better choice to promote nerve recovery.

title: Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome occurring after COVID19 infection and administration of Casirivimab + Imdevimab (COVID19 monoclonal antibody).
abstract: Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (WAHA) is the most common form of autoimmune hemolysis and there is a growing body of evidence of an association between SARS-CoV-2 infection, WAHA and a hyperinflammatory state, including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome. However, there is no literature to date of WAHA or hyperinflammatory state following administration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody treatment. This report documents a case of a patient with history of WAHA who developed brisk hemolysis and a hyperinflammatory state consistent with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome after COVID-19 infection and treatment with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody. He was successfully treated with multimodal treatment involving steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, rituximab, anakinra, and vincristine with resolution of the hemolysis.

title: Trifoliate gallbladder: A rare congenital anomaly masquerading as acute cholecystitis.
abstract: KEY CLINICAL MESSAGE: Triple gallbladder, an extremely rare congenital anomaly, can mimic more common biliary conditions. Accurate diagnosis through imaging and a multidisciplinary approach is essential for timely surgical management, preventing complications, and ensuring better patient outcomes. ABSTRACT: The multiplication of the gallbladder is a congenital malformation with a rare incidence of 1 in 4000 patients, among which the trifoliate gallbladder, even rarer, is included. Gallbladder anomalies are typically discovered incidentally while investigating conditions like gallstones, sedimentation, gallbladder inflammation, or malignancy. The clinical presentation of trifoliate gallbladder disease varies, and it may require a variety of imaging modalities to obtain a preoperative diagnosis. Recommended therapeutics for this anomaly are open or laparoscopic cholecystectomy, depending on the patient's condition. Early diagnosis of gallbladder multiplications is vital to improve prognosis and mitigate the risk of complications like cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, metaplasia, and adenocarcinoma. In our case, we present a 30-year-old male with the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis with triple gallbladder. A confirmatory diagnosis was made with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). The patient responded well to the therapy given and was discharged for follow-up.

abstract: <b>Background</b>  No consensus exists regarding surgical intervention for rheumatoid nodule-related pneumothorax. Clinical policy decisions rely on individual clinicians' experience and are usually intractable. <b>Case Description</b>  A 50-year-old man with a difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis-related pneumothorax was successfully treated with pedicle omentoplasty without recurrence at approximately 2 years posttreatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient where pneumothorax did not recur due to firm adhesions despite fluctuating postoperative rheumatoid nodules, as captured by regular computed tomography imaging follow-ups. <b>Conclusion</b>  Pedicled omentoplasty is effective for rheumatoid nodule-related pneumothorax as it reduces pneumothorax recurrence.

abstract: Despite significant improvements in prognosis, a subset of patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) remains at high risk for relapse. The treatment of relapsed and refractory (R/R) PCNSL remains a major clinical challenge. Herein, we present a 24-year-old patient with PCNSL who relapsed 4 years after initial diagnosis and subsequently became refractory to high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX), temozolomide, whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), ibrutinib, and lenalidomide. She received thiotepa with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody and achieved partial remission and then underwent autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) with thiotepa-based conditioning. Post-transplant maintenance with thiotepa and anti-PD-1 at 3-month intervals resulted in a durable complete response (CR) in this case of R/R PCNSL. Our report highlights the important role of thiotepa in the treatment of patients with R/R PCNSL.

title: Acupuncture therapy for Parkinson's disease: a case report demonstrating symptomatic improvement without medication.
abstract: BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) often necessitates immediate medical intervention following diagnosis. In recent years, there has been a noticeable increase in clinical investigations assessing the efficacy of acupuncture in PD, with many studies reporting positive outcomes. Ethical guidelines commonly endorse pharmaceutical therapies for PD, leading ongoing research to combine acupuncture with standard drug-based treatments. At present, there is a conspicuous absence of dedicated clinical research exclusively examining the independent impact of acupuncture on PD treatment. CASE: In a clinical observation, we documented a case involving a 75-year-old male displaying progressive, characteristic PD symptoms, including evident limb tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, fatigue, and additional non-motor symptoms. The patient received a confirmed diagnosis of PD. Due to the refusal of the patient to take medication, we exclusively administered acupuncture therapy. The outcomes indicated a noteworthy enhancement in the clinical symptoms of the patient solely through acupuncture intervention. CONCLUSION: This case affirms that using acupuncture in isolation significantly improved both the motor and non-motor symptoms in the patient. Acupuncture could potentially serve as an alternative therapy for patients who decline or are intolerant to anti-Parkinson drugs. However, further studies are needed to assess its long-term efficacy. This case report obtained approval from the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine (Ethics number: K-2023-127).

title: Successful ablation of Purkinje ectopy-triggered ventricular fibrillation storm in a patient with orthotopic heart transplantation and severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia: a case report.
abstract: BACKGROUND: Catheter ablation is one of the most effective treatment options for patients with drug-refractory, scar-related monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). In selected cases, catheter ablation also plays an important role in treatment of polymorphic VT (PMVT) and/or ventricular fibrillation (VF). Rarely, premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) originating from the Purkinje network can induce PMVT/VF. Ablation and elimination of these PVCs can prevent VF recurrences. CASE SUMMARY: A 41-year-old patient with a history of orthotopic heart transplantation (HTX) 8 years before admission and newly diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia was referred to our centre after experiencing several episodes of drug-refractory VF. An electrophysiological study showed ectopy-triggered VF originating from the anterior and posterior fascicles of the left bundle branch (LBB). Ablation of these PVCs from the LBB led to complete elimination of VF. A subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator was implanted as secondary prophylaxis. During the observation period of 6 months, no VF recurrence was observed. CONCLUSION: Identifying and eliminating the trigger (PVCs) can be life-saving and prevent VF in the specific cohort of HTX patients. High-density mapping using multipolar catheters with microelectrodes contributes significantly to our understanding of tachycardia mechanisms.

title: Case report: A novel perspective on the treatment of primary tracheal small cell carcinoma: a patient's experience with immuno-combined EP therapy and literature review.
abstract: Tracheal small cell carcinoma (SCC) is a rare malignancy, for which the optimal treatment strategy has yet to be determined. Currently, treatment largely aligns with the therapeutic guidelines established for small cell lung cancer, although numerous unresolved issues remain. This paper details a case study of a patient with Stage IIIB primary tracheal SCC, who was treated with an immune-combined etoposide-platinum(EP) regimen. This treatment offers valuable insights into innovative approaches for managing such malignancies. Furthermore, the study includes a comprehensive literature review to better contextualize the findings. The patient, admitted on May 2, 2023, had been experiencing persistent symptoms of airway discomfort for 15 days. A bronchoscopy performed on May 4 revealed tracheal SCC, classified as T4N2M0, IIIB. Following the CAPSTONE-1 study's methodology, the patient underwent six cycles of PD-L1(adebrelimab) combined with EP therapy, leading to significant relief of symptoms and the eventual disappearance of the tracheal mass.

title: Case report: Giant lymph node metastases: a new opportunity for cancer radioimmunotherapy?
abstract: BACKGROUND: Despite the significant progress made in radiotherapy and chemotherapy for the treatment of cervical cancer, patients with lymph node metastasis still have a poor prognosis. It is widely accepted that lymph node metastasis plays a crucial role in the spread of cancer to other organs and is considered an independent factor in predicting a poor prognosis. However, recent research suggests that the importance of lymph nodes in tumor therapy needs to be reevaluated, as preserving the integrity of lymph nodes before immunotherapy can enhance treatment effectiveness. CASE PRESENTATION: In this report, we present two cases of advanced cervical cancer patients with giant metastatic lymph node lesions in the neck. These patients were effectively treated with a combination of local radiotherapy and immunotherapy after conventional chemoradiotherapy had failed. The combination therapy resulted in significant clinical improvements, with patient 1 achieving over 12 months of progression-free survival (PFS) and patient 2 maintaining sustained remission for an impressive 24 months. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of local radiotherapy and immunotherapy shows promise as a viable treatment option for cervical cancer patients with distant lymph node metastasis, and the giant lymph node metastases may play an important role in this process, which might provide a new opportunity for cancer radioimmunotherapy.

title: Concurrence of dermatomyositis and psoriasis: a case report and literature review.
abstract: Dermatomyositis (DM) is a type of inflammatory myopathy with unknown causes. It is characterized by distinct skin lesions, weakness in the muscles close to the body, and the potential to affect multiple organs. Additionally, it may be associated with the presence of malignancies. The development of DM is influenced by genetic susceptibility, autoimmune response, and various external factors like cancer, drugs, and infectious agents. Psoriasis is a chronic, recurring, inflammatory, and systemic condition. Scaly erythema or plaque is the typical skin manifestation. The etiology of psoriasis involves genetic, immune, environmental and other factors. It is uncommon for a patient to have both of these diseases simultaneously, although individuals with DM may occasionally exhibit symptoms similar to those of psoriasis. Our patient was diagnosed with psoriasis in his 50s because of scalp squamous plaques, but he did not receive standard treatment. Ten years later, he developed symptoms of muscle pain and limb weakness. He was diagnosed with psoriasis complicated with dermatomyositis in our department and received corresponding treatment. Moreover, we reviewed the relevant literature to evaluate similarities and differences in clinical manifestation and treatment to other cases.

title: Triple Stentriever "Bouquet" Deployment with Zoom 88 Large-Bore Aspiration and Walrus Balloon-Guide Catheter for the Definitive Thrombectomy of a Carotid Free-Floating Thrombus.
abstract: Formation of a carotid free-floating thrombus (CFFT) is a rare and life-threatening condition without an optimal management plan. A 78-year-old woman with a history of prior right internal carotid artery (ICA) mechanical thrombectomy and antiplatelet noncompliance presented with transient ischemic attacks secondary to a recurrent CFFT in the right ICA. Given her symptoms and recurrent CFFT, endovascular mechanical thrombectomy was performed. A balloon guide-catheter (BGC) and a Zoom 88 distal access catheter were brought into the right distal common carotid artery and proximal ICA bulb, respectively. Three 0.021-inch microcatheters, each loaded with a unique stentriever, were navigated beyond the thrombus into the upper cervical ICA and deployed in a bouquet fashion. The BGC was inflated to achieve flow arrest, and the Zoom 88 aspiration catheter was tracked over the three bouquet stentrievers to ingest the thrombus. Follow-up angiography demonstrated recanalization of the proximal cervical ICA without evidence of residual thrombus. Twenty-four-hour postoperative computed tomography imaging did not reveal any evidence of new infarction. The patient was discharged home with an intact neurological examination, compliant on aspirin and apixaban. We demonstrate a novel technique utilizing a large-bore catheter with a triple stentriever "bouquet" to thrombectomize a CFFT.

abstract: This case report delves into the often overlooked and unacknowledged hazards faced by medical students, exemplified by a rare incident of nitric acid burns. A 19-year-old male medical student with no notable medical, surgical, or familial history suffered a spillage of 69% nitric acid on the anterior aspect of the right thigh while engaged in laboratory work. Swift action, including immediate wound irrigation, application of silver sulfadiazine, and subsequent hospitalization, proved crucial in mitigating the burn's severity. Though vitally stable, the patient exhibited a distinctive color change in the wound during observation. Admitted to the general surgery ward, outpatient follow-ups revealed successful wound healing within four weeks, emphasizing the importance of prompt intervention and meticulous care in addressing chemical burn injuries among medical students. This report sheds light on the often-underestimated dangers inherent in pursuing medical education.

abstract: We present a case of <i>Listeria monocytogenes </i>brain abscess in an immunocompromised patient admitted for stroke-like symptoms of headache and aphasia. Computerized tomography of the head revealed a 1.7 x 1.3 cm left frontal lobe lesion with surrounding edema, secondary to stroke, tumor, or abscess. Magnetic resonance imaging brain revealed a ring-enhancing lesion and a small contralateral area of restricted diffusion. Two of the two blood cultures grew an organism identified as <i>L. monocytogenes</i> using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Treatment with ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfa yielded marked symptomatic improvement. A brain biopsy was consistent with bacterial abscess. The patient's clinical course was favorable, with improved aphasia and negative follow-up blood cultures. A literature review found a limited number of <i>L. monocytogenes</i> abscess cases and none had clear guidelines for diagnosis. Recent studies have proposed five criteria for diagnosis. Our patient fulfilled three of these proposed guidelines.

title: A Clinical Suspicion of Quetiapine-Induced Psychosis: A Case Report and Literature Review.
abstract: Quetiapine, a pharmacological agent within the class of atypical antipsychotics, is characterized by its efficacy in mood stabilization and its role in the modulation of serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways. Its therapeutic utility is broad, encompassing the management of acute psychotic episodes, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and treatment-resistant depressive states. Quetiapine's effectiveness extends to depressive disorders that do not exhibit classic psychotic features, with a side effect profile that is less burdensome than many alternative psychotropic medications. Its versatility in addressing a range of psychiatric conditions is useful in the psychopharmacological management of mood and thought disorders. However, like all drugs, quetiapine may have different effects relative to the individual. It is imperative to approach the administration of quetiapine carefully, ensuring any adverse effects are ameliorated for beneficial therapeutic outcomes. In this case report, we present a psychosis-naive 42-year-old male who developed psychotic symptoms after beginning a quetiapine regimen in order to manage major depressive disorder with suicidal ideation. Clinical suspicion of quetiapine-induced psychosis was a diagnosis considered due to symptom remission secondary to ziprasidone in the place of quetiapine. The determination of a suspected adverse drug reaction can utilize the Naranjo scale to demonstrate the likelihood of an adverse drug reaction. This patient scored a three on the Naranjo scale, indicating a possible adverse effect from quetiapine. Other potential etiologies of psychosis include medication-induced psychosis, major depressive disorder exacerbation, cocaine use/withdrawal, and brief psychotic disorder. Quetiapine-induced psychosis has not been described in the current literature, and therefore, this case report is solely based on clinical evaluation and is intended for educational purposes due to possible confounding factors and etiologies.

title: Allopurinol-Induced Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis.
abstract: Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare and life-threatening cutaneous disease, frequently triggered by drugs. Allopurinol is one of the most frequent drugs associated with TEN, which implies detachment of a significant amount of the body surface area (BSA) and has a high morbidity and mortality associated with it. We present the case of a 68-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of hyperuricemia who started treatment with allopurinol. A week later, she presented to the emergency department with an extensive maculopapular exanthema with blisters and skin detachment. After the exclusion of other etiologies, the diagnosis of allopurinol-induced TEN was made, with 35% of BSA involvement. Due to the severity of the clinical condition, she was admitted to intensive care and treated with corticoids that had no response. So, she was started on immunoglobulins and transferred to a burn unit. She developed sepsis with multiorgan failure and required supportive treatment. She was discharged after a month, and physical rehabilitation was needed. This clinical case highlights the severity of allopurinol hypersensitivity that may happen and the importance of an accurate diagnosis and treatment for this rare disease.

abstract: A 45-year-old male developed a skin eruption after starting Desvenlafaxine for depressive symptoms associated with schizophreniform disorder. The patient developed a rash on the hand, hyperpigmentation, and itching, which resolved after discontinuing the medication. The Naranjo score suggested a probable link between desvenlafaxine and the skin reaction. Stable vital signs and normal labs supported this conclusion. The case underscores the importance of recognizing and reporting adverse drug reactions, even with generally safe medications like desvenlafaxine. Further research with larger samples is needed to explore this relationship in more depth.

title: Posttraumatic Cavovarus Deformity Due to a Varus Malunited Talar Neck Fracture, Treated With Corrective Talar Osteotomy: A Case Report.
abstract: Although talar fractures are frequent bone injuries, fracture displacements of the talar neck are rare, and they can lead to under-treatment and poor prognosis. Furthermore, maltreatment of the talar fractures leads to complications such as malunion (which is the most common), nonunion, osteonecrosis and hindfoot arthritis, which can cause significant disability. The most common position of the talar neck malunion is the varus malunion. Alternative treatments include open reduction with or without bone grafting, open reduction combined with ankle fusion, talar neck osteotomy and talar neck osteotomy combined with subtalar fusion. However, the outcomes of foot function after corrective arthrodesis are poor. In this paper, we present a patient who underwent an open wedge corrective osteotomy of the talus for a cavovarus deformity developed after a malunion of a comminuted talar neck fracture. The patient walked normally three months postoperatively.

title: Silent Echoes: A Case Report of Wernicke Encephalopathy's Unheard Voice.
abstract: Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) is an acute neuropsychiatric emergency that is caused by a deficiency in vitamin B1 (thiamine). This condition is most commonly seen in patients with alcohol use disorder; however, patients with other disorders of severe malnourishment are also at increased risk. In severe cases, this disease may be followed by Korsakoff's psychosis and even death.  We present a case of a 64-year-old African American female with a history of alcohol use disorder who presented to the emergency department on account of an acute confusional state. Neurological examination revealed right beating nystagmus on the left gaze and a wide-based gait. Initial laboratory work-up was unrevealing; however, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain demonstrated an abnormal T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal involving the bilateral mammillary bodies and surrounding lateral ventricles that extended into the periaqueductal parenchyma. The patient was admitted to the neurology unit, and high-dose intravenous thiamine was commenced. During hospitalization, the patient's confusion improved and they were subsequently discharged with oral thiamine. The spectrum of severity of WE is wide, ranging from fatal disease and can lead to permanent brain damage or even Korsakoff syndrome, characterized by severe memory loss and confabulation. The diagnosis is mainly clinical and based on the presence of symptoms in the classic triad of mental status change, oculomotor abnormality, and ataxia. This triad is only present in about 10% of cases, making the diagnosis very challenging. Laboratory testing can assist in making the diagnosis, but it is not always reliable or available. In situations of clinical uncertainty, imaging may also be used to support diagnosis or rule out other differentials. The mainstay of treatment is with high-dose parenteral thiamine.

abstract: Moya-Moya disease (MMD) is a rare cerebral vasculopathy affecting children and adults. It is a progressive steno-occlusive arterial disease generally discovered during the etiological assessment of an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Its diagnosis is based essentially on imaging. Cerebral digital subtraction angiography (DSA) remains the gold standard. We report the case of a 42-year-old male patient admitted for the loss of consciousness with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 12/15. A brain CT scan revealed a right capsulo-lenticular hematoma with ventricular flooding and hydrocephalus. Cerebral CT angiography showed features of Moya-Moya vasculopathy, which was confirmed by a cerebral catheter angiogram.

title: Dextrocardia With Situs Inversus in a COVID-19 Patient.
abstract: With an estimated incidence of one in 10,000 to one in 50,000 patients, Situs inversus totalis (SIT) is a rare innate anomaly, portraying a mirror image of the normal anatomy, as the cardiac position and abdominal viscera are completely inverted. Despite the fact that physicians and researchers have been dealing with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic for three years, there is a lack of published data examining the potential effects of anatomic variations on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. This study aimed to contribute to this domain by presenting a rare case of a COVID-19 infection coexisting with SIT as one of the very few cases reporting the simultaneous presence of the two pathologies. We sought to present this case of COVID-19 in a quinquagenarian female, in whom SIT was an incidental radiological finding. The reversed anatomy did not seem to affect the clinical progression of the virus. However, due to the lack of scientific evidence, the potential long-term effects, if any, of COVID-19 on SIT cannot be predicted. The recognition of the mirror pattern will offer a personalized treatment plan, reducing the risk of severe complications and management mishaps.

title: Characterization of Diabetic Striatopathy With Repeated Follow-Up Using Multiple Imaging Studies.
abstract: Diabetic striatopathy is a rare condition with a prevalence of less than one in 100,000. Herein, we report a case of diabetic striatopathy exacerbated by hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, with repeated follow-up with multiple imaging studies. This case suggested that putamen neuronal loss and dysfunction, gliosis, and ischemia are associated with diabetic striatopathy pathophysiology. In addition, striatal hyperintensity on T1-weighted MRI images was more pronounced after symptom remission when evaluated several times over a short period. Therefore, clinicians should be aware that even if MRI findings are normal in the very early stages of the onset of diabetic striatopathy, repeating MRIs at intervals may reveal typical findings.

abstract: Worldwide medical and scientific communities are focusing on further understanding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) complications and its long-term impact on survivors. Pneumatocele cases are being reported more as a consequence of this virus and a cause of pneumothorax in certain patients. In this case vignette, we present a previously healthy male with COVID-19 symptoms who required hospitalization for hypoxia and who required readmission for bilateral pneumothorax from the delayed rupture of pneumatoceles. We describe this rare pathology and provide hypotheses for possible etiologies.

title: Tumefactive Crohn's Disease Mimicking Colon Carcinoma in a Young Female: A Case Report.
abstract: Tumefactive Crohn's disease is a rare form of Crohn's disease that may mimic colon carcinoma macroscopically. This case report describes a 28-year-old female who presented with right-sided abdominal pain and a palpable abdominal mass that had persisted for over a month. Multiple hospitalizations failed to provide an accurate diagnosis until an exploratory laparotomy revealed that the "mass" was the cecum and a perforated ascending colon. A partial right colectomy was performed, sending the specimen for biopsy. The microscopic description showed dense and confluent chronic inflammation in the colonic mucosa and wall, extending to the serosa in some regions. The infiltration comprised lymphocytes and plasma cells, with an admixture of some neutrophils. Aphthous mucosal ulcerations, intramural fissures, and fistulas were present. Immunostains for pan-keratin demonstrated no intramural epithelial elements. The characteristics of this lesion represent tumefactive Crohn's disease. This case highlights the key microscopic characteristics that pathologists look for when differentiating Crohn's disease from colon carcinoma in a patient presenting with abdominal pain and a colon mass.

title: Bilateral Adrenal Hemorrhage Heralds Bronchogenic Carcinoma.
abstract: This case study delves into the unusual presentation of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), where bilateral hemorrhagic adrenal metastasis served as the primary indication of an underlying malignancy. Our patient, a 58-year-old male, sought medical attention due to acute abdominal pain and lower back discomfort, leading to an in-depth diagnostic exploration. Radiological examinations revealed bilateral adrenal masses exhibiting hemorrhagic characteristics, a distinctive feature not commonly associated with NSCLC. The subsequent biopsy and histopathological analysis definitively identified metastatic NSCLC as the culprit. The uniqueness of this case lies in the bilateral nature of the metastasis and the presence of hemorrhagic elements, challenging traditional diagnostic expectations. This report emphasizes the necessity for a nuanced approach to diagnostic investigations when confronted with atypical presentations, especially considering the rarity of bilateral involvement and hemorrhagic features in adrenal metastases from NSCLC. It highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration between radiologists, pathologists, and oncologists to ensure accurate and timely diagnosis. The overarching significance of this case extends beyond its rarity; it underscores the imperative for healthcare practitioners to broaden their diagnostic considerations in the absence of conventional symptoms. By presenting this distinctive case, we contribute to the evolving understanding of the diverse clinical manifestations of NSCLC, advocating for heightened vigilance and comprehensive diagnostic approaches in the pursuit of early intervention and optimal patient care.

title: The Management of Drug-Induced Gingival Enlargement in a Patient With Preexisting Periodontitis.
abstract: Antihypertensives such as amlodipine, which is a family of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), possess a limitation by causing gingival enlargement on long-term use. Gingival enlargement hinders the patient's oral hygiene maintenance and causes more plaque accumulation and inflammation. The severity of the condition is dependent on dose and duration. When untreated, this leads to functional and esthetic disabilities. This is a case report of amlodipine-induced gingival enlargement in a young, chronic periodontitis patient who was under 5 mg of amlodipine for six months. Upon diagnosis, the patient underwent periodontal surgery and supportive periodontal therapy, which significantly improved her periodontal health in a one-year follow-up period.

title: A Case of Long-Tract Ileocolic Intussusception Secondary to Well-Differentiated Cecal Adenocarcinoma.
abstract: Intussusception denotes the intricate phenomenon wherein one segment of the bowel undergoes invagination or telescoping into its contiguous distal segment. The ensuing invaginated segment may be propelled forward through peristaltic movements, potentially precipitating bowel obstruction or ischemia, culminating in necrosis of the affected bowel segment. Although the precise etiology of intussusception remains elusive, particularly in cases devoid of an identifiable lead point, dysrhythmic contractions and lymphoid hyperplasia have been implicated in the pathophysiology of this condition. We present the case of an 86-year-old African American female with a past medical history of hypertension and asthma who presented to our emergency room with a seven-day history of worsening abdominal. The pain was described as sharp and intermittent, and it would worsen with every meal or drink. A physical exam demonstrated the right lower quadrant with vague abdominal tenderness, especially below the umbilical region. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a long segment of ileocolic obstructing intussusception in the ascending colon, with a 2.6 cm solid mass serving as a lead point. Swift intervention ensued with an urgent exploratory laparotomy, culminating in a right hemicolectomy to excise the intussuscepted segment of the bowel. The pathological examination identified a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the cecum, categorized as T1N0M0, with all 20 resected lymph nodes yielding negative results. This illustrative case presents a unique insight into a patient with ileocolic obstructing intussusception, caused by a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma acting as the lead point, a relatively uncommon occurrence in adults. Diagnosing intussusception in adults is challenging due to its nonspecific symptoms, which are similar to those of various other gastrointestinal disorders. Therefore, it is crucial for medical providers to be acutely aware of the possibility that adenocarcinoma can trigger obstructing intussusception in various parts of the bowel.

title: Surgical Management of Severe Mandibular Actinomycosis: Segmental Mandibulectomy and Fibula Free Flap for Optimal Outcomes.
abstract: Actinomycosis is a chronic, suppurative, granulomatous bacterial infection primarily associated with <i>Actinomyces israelii</i>. The condition can be categorized into three distinct clinical types based on the affected anatomical region: cervicofacial, pulmonary, or abdominopelvic actinomycosis. The standard treatment for actinomycosis involves antibiotic therapy, with an empiric penicillin regimen as the first-line approach. Surgical interventions comprise curettage of the affected bone, resection of necrotic tissues, excision of existing sinus tracts, and drainage of abscesses. These procedures are considered a last resort for cases of actinomycosis unresponsive to antibiotic therapy. In this context, we present a case of severely unresponsive actinomycosis that necessitated aggressive surgical resection of the infected mandibular bone, followed by immediate reconstruction using a fibula-free flap. The outcome yielded both favorable functional and aesthetic results.

title: Case report: Refractory Evans syndrome in two patients with spondyloenchondrodysplasia with immune dysregulation treated successfully with JAK1/JAK2 inhibition.
abstract: Biallelic mutations in the <i>ACP5</i> gene cause spondyloenchondrodysplasia with immune dysregulation (SPENCDI). SPENCDI is characterized by the phenotypic triad of skeletal dysplasia, innate and adaptive immune dysfunction, and variable neurologic findings ranging from asymptomatic brain calcifications to severe developmental delay with spasticity. Immune dysregulation in SPENCDI is often refractory to standard immunosuppressive treatments. Here, we present the cases of two patients with SPENCDI and recalcitrant autoimmune cytopenias who demonstrated a favorable clinical response to targeted JAK inhibition over a period of more than 3 years. One of the patients exhibited steadily rising IgG levels and a bone marrow biopsy revealed smoldering multiple myeloma. A review of the literature uncovered that approximately half of the SPENCDI patients reported to date exhibited increased IgG levels. Screening for multiple myeloma in SPENCDI patients with rising IgG levels should therefore be considered.

title: Diffuse infantile hepatic hemangioma successfully treated with propranolol orally: a case report and literature review.
abstract: BACKGROUND: Infantile hepatic hemangioma (IHH) is a common vascular, fast-growing hepatic tumor that is usually accompanied by multiple cutaneous hemangiomas. Diffuse IHH (DIHH) is a rare type of IHH that exhibits many tumors with nearly complete hepatic parenchymal replacement. At present, there is no specific standardized treatment plan for DIHH. Herein, we present the case of a 2-month-old girl with DIHH and without cutaneous hemangioma who achieved complete remission after undergoing propranolol monotherapy. CASE PRESENTATION: The infant with low birth weight was presented to the pediatric department with a 2-month history of persistent vomiting and feeding difficulty. Ultrasonography and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging revealed hepatomegaly and diffused intrahepatic lesions. A computed tomography-guided percutaneous liver biopsy was performed, and the pathological examination suggested the diagnosis was DIHH. The patient exhibited remarkably response to an increasing dose of oral propranolol, from 0.5 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg every day. The intrahepatic lesions were almost completely regressed after one year of treatment and no distinct adverse reaction was observed. CONCLUSION: DIHH can induce life-threatening complications that require prompt interventions. Propranolol monotherapy can be an effective and safe first-line treatment strategy for DIHH.

title: Multiple pulmonary cavernous haemangiomas with concurrent primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma: a case report and literature review.
abstract: BACKGROUND: Cavernous haemangiomas (CHs) commonly occurred in the skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscles, and liver. Pulmonary cavernous haemangiomas (PCHs) are quite rare and usually present with nonspecific clinical symptoms. When lung cancer patients are complicated with pulmonary cavernous haemangiomas, radiologically, these haemangioma lesions can be easily misinterpreted as intrapulmonary metastases, potentially resulting in misdiagnosis, or missed diagnosis. CASE PRESENTATION: The present study reported the case of a 53-year-old female patient with pulmonary adenocarcinoma coexisting with multiple PCHs. <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) showed an elevated glucose metabolism in the apicoposterior segment of the left upper lobe; however, the other nodules were not hypermetabolic. Percutaneous lung biopsy was performed on the nodule in the apicoposterior segment of the left upper lobe, which were diagnosed as primary adenocarcinoma. Some nodules in the upper left lobe underwent wedge resection by video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and intraoperative frozen section identified as PCHs. Finally, the patient underwent lobectomy of the left upper lobe via VATS, cancerous nodule in the apicoposterior segment of the left upper lobe underwent genetic molecular testing of PCR-Sanger sequencing, suggested <i>EGFR</i> mutation, and patient received treatment with Osimertinib. During the 4-months follow-up, contrast-enhanced CT showed no recurrence of either disease. PCHs are rare benign tumours of the lung, which can lead to misdiagnosis due to their non-specific clinical symptoms and radiological features, especially when they coexist with lung cancer. PCHs is easily misunderstood as metastatic lung cancer, in this case, PET-CT can assist in differentiating benign from malignant. For the cases of early lung cancer complicated with PCHs, lung cancer can be surgically resected, and whether PCHs should be removed or not should be determined according to the size and distribution of the lesions.

title: Case report: Exceptional disease progression in a 70-year-old patient: generalized melanosis and melanuria in the course of metastatic melanoma - a case study.
abstract: This case study documents an extraordinary disease progression in a 70-year-old patient diagnosed with metastatic melanoma. The patient's condition advanced to an unusual manifestation characterized by generalized melanosis and melanuria, a rare and foreboding complication of metastatic melanoma. The clinical presentation involved rapid-onset skin darkening, primarily affecting the face and torso, along with darkened urine, marking the onset of melanuria. Despite extensive diagnostic evaluations, including abdominal ultrasound, neck ultrasound, thoracic CT scans, and endoscopic examinations, the exact metastatic sites remained elusive, demonstrating the diagnostic challenges associated with this condition. Laboratory tests revealed abnormal hematological and biochemical markers, along with elevated S100 protein levels, indicating disease progression. The patient underwent a surgical skin biopsy that confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic melanoma, leading to a multidisciplinary approach to treatment. Following this, the patient-initiated chemotherapy with dacarbazine (DTIC). Regrettably, this was necessitated by the absence of reimbursement for BRAF and MEK inhibitors as well as immunotherapy, and it subsequently led to rapid disease progression and a decline in the patient's clinical condition. The patient's condition further complicated with erysipelas and increased distress, ultimately leading to their unfortunate demise. This case highlights the aggressive nature of generalized melanosis, characterized by a rapid clinical course, substantial pigmentation, and limited response to conventional chemotherapy. Importantly, the patient had a BRAF mutation, emphasizing the urgency of exploring alternative treatment strategies. Patients with a BRAF mutation are excellent candidates for BRAF and MEK inhibitor treatment, potentially allowing them to extend their lifespan if this therapy were available. The challenges encountered in diagnosing, managing, and treating this aggressive form of metastatic melanoma underline the need for early detection, tailored therapeutic approaches, and ongoing research efforts to improve patient outcomes in such cases.

title: Allo-HSCT with TBI-based preconditioning for hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma: two case reports and systematic review of literature.
abstract: Hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma (HSTCL) is a particularly difficult-to-treat form of lymphoma, with many patients exhibiting primary resistance to chemotherapy. At present, no effective strategy for treating relapsed and refractory HSTCL has been established, with treatment being hampered by questions of how best to overcome chemoresistance to allow patients to attain more durable therapeutic benefits. While there have been marked advances in immunotherapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remains one of the primary approaches to curing HSTCL. Of patients who undergo immunochemotherapeutic treatment, many are resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs yet remain sensitive to radiotherapy. We selected to employ a transplant pretreatment regimen consisting of total -body irradiation (TBI) and administered this regimen to two patients with HSTCL. Both patients achieved complete remission (CR) after transplantation, demonstrating extended periods without disease recurrence. We systematic reviewed previously published instances involving allo-HSCT in patients with HSTCL. We have found a total of 67 patients who have received allo-HSCT. In general, age<45 and the status of CR at HSCT may have a more favorable prognosis. Although the impact of TBI on prognosis was not found to be substantial, patients in the TBI group had higher 3-year overall survival (66.7% vs. 71.1%) and 5-year overall survival (58.4% vs. 71.1%) compared to patients in the non-TBI group. In addition, the relapse rate of the TBI group is approximately half that of the non-TBI group. This regimen is well tolerated and associated with low recurrence rates or complications, suggesting that it represents a viable pretreatment regimen for young HSTCL patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT.

title: Case report and literature analysis: solitary HCC- recurrence in the right maxillary sinus after curative resection.
abstract: BACKGROUND: The primary treatment for eligible patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is curative liver resection, offering a 5-year overall survival (OS) of 60%-80%. Despite this, the recurrence rate within five years post-resection remains notably high, ranging from 40% to 50%. Instances of recurrence in the maxillary sinus following liver resection are exceedingly uncommon. This report details a unique case of solitary maxillary sinus recurrence after the curative resection of HCC, which underwent maxillary tumor resection, along with a comprehensive review of pertinent literature. No similar cases have been documented previously. CASE PRESENTATION: In 2014, an 85-year-old male patient was diagnosed with HCC and subsequently underwent left hepatectomy. Following the resection, the patient underwent a 9-year follow-up period without any evidence of intra or extrahepatic recurrence. In 2023, a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 1.4 cm by 1.1 cm mass in the maxillary sinus, without discernible invasion of the alveolar sinus, nasal cavity, orbital cavity, or infratemporal space. We proceeded with the resection of the maxillary sinus mass. Patho-histochemical analysis indicated that the tumor cells in the maxillary sinus were metastatic HCC cells. As of now, the patient remains in good condition with no signs of tumor recurrence. CONCLUSION: For patients presenting with solitary maxillary sinus metastasis, optimal liver function, and a favorable performance score, tumor resection may be the preferred treatment option. However, given the rarity of such cases, larger prospective trials are essential to determine an optimal treatment strategy that offers therapeutic benefits.

abstract: Sinistral portal hypertension (SPH), also known as segmental portal hypertension, is a complication of pancreatic disorders and an extremely rare cause of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. SPH is observed in patients without cirrhosis and arises from splenic vein thrombosis. Unmitigated backflow of blood may cause gastric venous congestion and ultimately GI hemorrhage. Herein, we report a rare case of massive hematemesis due to SPH in a male patient with a history of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic pseudocyst. Our patient was successfully treated with endoscopic necrosectomy followed by open splenectomy, distal pancreatectomy, and partial gastric resection.

title: Prenatal diagnosis of non-typical Chiari malformation type I associated with de novo Nuclear Factor I A gene mutation: a case report.
abstract: BACKGROUND: Chiari malformation is one of the most common Central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities that can be detected in routine fetal scanning. Chiari malformation type I (CMI) is a congenital defect characterized by a displacement of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum. The etiology of CMI has not been well established and suggested having multifactorial contributions, especially genetic deletion. Clinical characteristics of this anomaly may express in different symptoms from neurological dysfunction and/or skeletal abnormalities in the later age, but it is rarely reported in pregnancy. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case in which the Chiari malformation type I was diagnosed with comorbidities of facial anomalies (flatting forehead and micrognathia) and muscular-skeletal dysmorphologies (clenched hands and clubfeet) at the 24<sup>+6</sup> weeks of gestation in a 29-year-old Vietnamese pregnant woman. The couple refused an amniocentesis, and the pregnancy was followed up every 4 weeks until a spontaneous delivery occurred at 38 weeks. The newborn had a severe asphyxia and seizures at birth required to have an emergency resuscitation at delivery. He is currently being treated in the intensive neonatal care unit. He carries the novel heterozygous NFIA gene mutation confirmed after birth. No further postnatal malformation detected. CONCLUSION: CMI may only represent with facial abnormalities and muscle-skeletal malformations at the early stage of pregnancy, which may also alert an adverse outcome. A novel heterozygous NFIA gene mutation identified after birth helps to confirm prenatal diagnosis of CMI and to provide an appropriate consultation.

title: Corticosteroid treatment for acute hydrocephalus in neurosarcoidosis: a case report.
abstract: BACKGROUND: Neurosarcoidosis occurs symptomatically in 5-10% of patients with sarcoidosis, and hydrocephalus is a rare complication of neurosarcoidosis, with either acute or subacute onset and presenting symptoms related to increased intracranial pressure. It represents a potentially fatal manifestation with a mortality rate of 22% (increased to 75% in case of coexistence of seizures) that requires a prompt initiation of treatment. High-dose intravenous corticosteroid treatment and neurosurgical treatment must be considered in all cases of neurosarcoidosis hydrocephalus. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we present a case of hydrocephalus in neurosarcoidosis, complicated by generalized seizures, in a 29-year-old Caucasian male patient treated with medical treatment only, with optimal response. CONCLUSION: Since neurosurgery treatment can lead to severe complications, this case report underlines the possibility to undergo only medical treatment in selected cases. Further studies are needed to stratify patients and better identify those eligible for only medical approach.

title: Gait analysis of a patient after femoral nerve and malignant soft tissue tumor resections: a case report.
abstract: BACKGROUND: Malignant femoral soft tissue tumors are occasionally resected together with the femoral nerves, but this can cause loss of knee extensor muscle activity. To the best of our knowledge, no previous reports have detailed the gait analysis of such cases in combination with electromyography. Herein, we report the gait analysis of a patient who underwent left groin synovial sarcoma and left femoral nerve resection 12 years ago. CASE PRESENTATION: We analyzed the gait of a 38-year-old man who was able to walk unaided after the resection of a synovial sarcoma in the left groin together with the ipsilateral femoral nerve. The muscle activities of the affected medial (MH) and lateral hamstrings (LH), and lateral heads of the gastrocnemius (GL) were increased during 50-75% of the stance phase. The hip flexion angle of the affected limb was smaller, and the ankle plantar flexion angle of the affected limb was larger than that of the non-affected limb. This means that in the affected limb, the hip and ankle angles were adjusted to prevent knee collapse, and the MH, LH, and GL muscles contributed in the mid- and late-stance phases. Moreover, we found that the hamstring and gastrocnemius of the affected limb worked together to keep the ipsilateral knee extended in the mid-stance phase and slightly flexed in the late-stance phase. CONCLUSIONS: Patients capable of walking after femoral nerve resection may control their hamstrings and gastrocnemius muscles collaboratively to prevent ipsilateral knee collapse in the mid- and late-stance phases.

title: 46, XX disorder of sexual development associated with mixed germ cell tumor of the prostate: a rare case report.
abstract: BACKGROUND: Extragonadal germ cell tumors originating from the prostate are exceptionally rare. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reported cases of mixed germ cell tumors in individuals with 46 XX disorder of sex development. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis using whole genome sequencing to investigate the clinicopathological and molecular genetic characteristics of a submitted case, with the objective of elucidating its underlying pathogenesis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old male patient was diagnosed with a combination of 46, XX disorder of sex development and a primary prostate mixed germ cell tumor with yolk sac tumor and teratoma components. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that the tumor cells had a high somatic mutational load. Analysis of genomic structural variations and copy number variants confirmed the patient's karyotype as 46, XX (SRY +). Additionally, the patient exhibited short stature, small bilateral testes, slightly enlarged breasts, elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein concentrations, elevated follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels, and low testosterone levels. DISCUSSION: A case of 46, XX disorder of sex development, along with a primary prostatic mixed germ cell tumor, was diagnosed. This diagnosis has contributed to advancing our understanding of the genetic and phenotypic profile of the disease and may provide some insights for its treatment.

title: Novel KMT2B gene mutation in MUC4 positive low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma.
abstract: BACKGROUND: Low-grade Fibromyxoid Sarcoma(LGFM)is a rare fibrosarcoma, which mainly occurs in young people and is mostly seen in the trunk and limbs. The tumor is usually FUS-CREB3L2 fusion caused by t(7;16)(q32-34;p11)chromosome translocation, and rarely FUS-CREB3L1 and EWSR1-CREB3L1 fusion. MUC4 diffuse strong positive can be used as a specific index of LGFM. LGFM is similar to Sclerosing Epithelioid Fibrosarcoma(SEF) and may have the same origin. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of LGFM in the chest wall. A female who is 59 years old. In 2016, CT showed dense nodule shadow and focal thickening of the left pleura, the patient underwent surgery, Pathological report that low to moderate malignant fibrosarcoma(fibromyxoid type). The CT re-examination in 2021 showed that the tumors on the left chest wall were significantly larger than before. Pathological examination showed the disease is composed of alternating collagen like and mucinous areas. Under high-power microscope, the tumor cells are consistent in shape, spindle or short spindle, and the tumor cells are arranged in bundles. In local areas, the density of tumor cells is significantly increased, mixed with collagen fibers, and small focal SEF appear. The result of immunohistochemistry showed that SMA, Desmin, CD34, STAT6, S100, SOX10, HMB45 and Melan A were negative, EMA was weakly positive, MUC4 was diffuse and strongly positive, and Ki67 index was low (3%). CONCLUSION: Sequencing results showed that MET, EGFR, KMT2B and RET gene were mutated in LGFM, and KMT2B gene had cancer promoting effect, but there was no literature report in LGFM, which may be of certain significance for the diagnosis and treatment of LGFM.

title: Successful application of airway pressure release ventilation in a child with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by trauma: a case report.
abstract: BACKGROUND: Trauma has been identified as one of the risk factors for acute respiratory distress syndrome. Respiratory support can be further complicated by comorbidities of trauma such as primary or secondary lung injury. Conventional ventilation strategies may not be suitable for all trauma-related acute respiratory distress syndrome. Airway pressure release ventilation has emerged as a potential rescue method for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and hypoxemia refractory to conventional mechanical ventilation. However, there is a lack of research on the use of airway pressure release ventilation in children with trauma-related acute respiratory distress syndrome. We report a case of airway pressure release ventilation applied to a child with falling injury, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, hemorrhagic shock, and bilateral hemopneumothorax. We hope this case report presents a potential option for trauma-related acute respiratory distress syndrome and serves as a basis for future research. CASE PRESENTATION: A 15-year-old female with falling injury who developed severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, hemorrhagic shock, and bilateral hemopneumothorax was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit. She presented refractory hypoxemia despite the treatment of conventional ventilation with deep analgesia, sedation, and muscular relaxation. Lung recruitment was ineffective and prone positioning was contraindicated. Her oxygenation significantly improved after the use of airway pressure release ventilation. She was eventually extubated after 12 days of admission and discharged after 42 days of hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Airway pressure release ventilation may be considered early in the management of trauma patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome when prone position ventilation cannot be performed and refractory hypoxemia persists despite conventional ventilation and lung recruitment maneuvers.

title: A prenatal case misunderstood as specimen confusion: 46,XY/46,XY chimerism.
abstract: Chimerism results from the fusion of two zygotes in a single embryo, whereas mosaicism results from mitotic errors in a single zygote. True human chimerism is rare, with fewer than 100 cases reported in the literature. Here, we report a case in which the fetus was identified as having tetragametic chimerism based on short tandem repeat - polymerase chain reaction analysis of the family observed during amniocentesis for advanced maternal age. The chimerism occurred via the fertilization of two ova by two spermatozoa, followed by the fusion of early embryos. The genotypes of the two amniotic fluid samples obtained successively by one puncture were completely different, and the sex chromosomes were XY. Karyotyping and copy number variation sequencing showed no abnormalities. The fetus was delivered at term and the phenotype of the newborn was normal.

title: Female vs. male relative fatality risk in fatal motor vehicle crashes in the US, 1975-2020.
abstract: Motor vehicle accidents are the leading cause of death for young adults 18-29 years old worldwide, resulting in nearly 1 million years of life lost annually in the United States. Despite improvements in vehicle safety technologies, young women are at higher risk of dying in car crashes compared with men in matched scenarios. Vehicle crash testing primarily revolves around test dummies representative of the 50th percentile adult male, potentially resulting in these differences in fatality risk for female occupants compared to males. Vehicle occupants involved in fatal car crashes were matched using seating location, vehicle type, airbag deployment, seatbelt usage, and age. The relative risk for fatality (R) between males and females was calculated using a Double Pair Comparison. Young women (20s-40s) are at approximately 20% higher risk of dying in car crashes compared with men of the same age in matched scenarios. In passenger cars, 25-year-old female occupants in passenger car crashes from 1975-2020 exhibit R = 1.201 (95% CI 1.160-1.250) compared to 25-year-old males, and R-1.117 (95% CI 1.040-1.207) for passenger car crashes from 2010-2020. This trend persists across vehicle type, airbag deployment, seatbelt use, and number of vehicles involved in a crash. Known sex-based differences do not explain this large risk differential, suggesting a need for expanded test methodologies and research strategies to address as-yet unexplored sex differences in crash fatalities. These differences should be further investigated to ensure equitable crash protection.

title: Belzutifan, HIF-2α Inhibitor, and Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma With Somatic Von-Hippel-Lindau Loss-of-Function Mutation.
abstract: The Von-Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene, acting as a tumor suppressor, plays a crucial role in the tumorigenesis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Approximately 90% of individuals with advanced ccRCC exhibit somatic mutations in the VHL gene. Belzutifan, orally administered small-molecule inhibitor of hypoxia-induced factor-2α, has demonstrated promising efficacy in solid tumors associated with germline loss-of-function mutations in VHL, including ccRCC. However, its impact on cases with somatic or sporadic VHL mutations remains unclear. Here, we present 2 cases where belzutifan monotherapy was employed in patients with advanced ccRCC and somatic loss-of-function mutations in VHL. Both patients exhibited a swift and sustained response, underscoring the potential role of belzutifan as a viable option in second or subsequent lines of therapy for individuals with somatic VHL mutations. Despite both patients experiencing a pulmonary crisis with respiratory compromise, their rapid response to belzutifan further emphasizes its potential utility in cases involving pulmonary or visceral crises. This report contributes valuable insights into the treatment landscape for advanced ccRCC with somatic VHL mutations.

title: Paraneoplastic Hyperthyroidism Secondary to a Chemotherapy-Induced Surge in β-hCG in a Patient with Non-Seminomatous Germ Cell Tumor.
abstract: Thyrotoxicosis as the presenting syndrome of an underlying β-hCG-secreting malignancy is well described. It has been previously theorized, but not reported, that the surge of β-hCG secondary to chemotherapy induction may inadvertently trigger thyrotoxicosis. After thorough review, this is the first documented case of such event in peer-reviewed medical literature published in the English language. This is a case of a 21-year-old male with stage IIIc non-seminomatous germ cell tumor who developed paraneoplastic hyperthyroidism within 4 days of the first cycle of chemotherapy. Management considerations are suggested based on this case and review of the literature.

title: Workflows and Laboratory Cost for Removable Digital Complete Denture: Two Case Reports with and without Existing Denture.
abstract: The integration of digital dentistry in the fabrication of complete dentures (CDs) has been facilitated through the use of intraoral scanners and computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM). However, the financial implications associated with the fabrication of digital CDs have been rarely explored. This study is aimed at presenting two different approaches to CD fabrication, combining conventional with digital techniques, and comparing the total cost of fabrication. The first case involved a 70-year-old woman without existing denture, while the second case involved a 97-year-old woman with inadequate retention and stability of CDs in both jaws. In the first patient, who lacked information about her old denture, the first approach was employed, utilizing milling technology for denture processing. The second patient, who already had an existing denture, underwent the second approach, which employed printing technology for denture processing. CAD/CAM replicas of the existing dentures were used for the final impression, bite registration, and as a guide for tooth arrangement. Two digital protocols and laboratory cost in CD fabrication have been proposed. The relatively high cost of CAD/CAM CDs restricts the widespread of digital technology in CD fabrication.

title: Postpartum Hypocupric Myelopathy Masquerading as Acute Transverse Myelitis: A Case Report and Literature Review of a Rare Presentation.
abstract: The symptoms of transverse myelitis, an acute demyelinating inflammatory condition of the spinal cord, include motor, sensory, and bowel-bladder dysfunction that can develop suddenly or gradually. Several etiologies, such as bacterial, fungal, or viral infections, cancer, autoimmune diseases, vascular problems, and environmental variables, can cause it. The identification of copper deficiency myelopathy (CDM) as a curable cause of non-compressive inflammatory myelopathy has only occurred recently. Patients frequently present with sensory complaints and a spastic gait. The neurological disease may exist independently of the hematologic signs. Only a few cases of copper myelopathy in peripartum women have been documented. Given that hypocupric myelopathy is a treatable cause of debilitating paraplegia, maintaining clinical vigilance will be crucial in minimizing neurological sequelae, as demonstrated in this case report.

title: Novel Surgical Approach for Large Intraosseous Subchondral Cysts of Talus: A Case Report and Technical Innovation.
abstract: Large subchondral bone cysts in the medial talar body and dome are common and can cause persistent pain and swelling during axial loading. Open debridement and bone grafting are often necessary to treat these lesions but can require extensive soft-tissue dissection or malleolar osteotomies. A 40-year-old woman presented with ankle pain and swelling for 1 year, worsening with activity and no history of trauma. X-rays showed a cystic lesion in the medial talar dome with no joint line disruption. CT confirmed the cystic lesion without bone collapse or expansion. An anterior approach to the ankle joint was extended to access the talar neck. A window was created in the talar neck to debride and curette the medial talar dome, and the void was filled with allograft. The patient was non-weight-bearing for 6 weeks, followed by gradual weight-bearing and ankle range of motion exercises starting on postoperative day 1. The patient returned to her pre-injury status within 3 months and was asymptomatic at the 6-year follow-up, with good bone graft integration and no symptoms. This technical note presents a novel approach to lesions of the medial talar body and dome through the talar neck, avoiding the need for malleolar osteotomy or disruption to the tibiotalar joint, and resulting in good functional outcomes.

title: Giant Poroid Hidradenoma of the Forearm.
abstract: Poroid hidradenoma represents an uncommon and benign tumor originating from skin adnexa. It falls under the category of sweet duct neoplasms, along with poromas. It affects the elderly population most frequently. Typically, it emerges as a small, distinct, and painless lump beneath the skin's surface, often occurring on the head and neck regions. It is characterized by a low risk of malignant transformation. Accurate identification relies especially on histomorphological analysis considering the intricate resemblance it shares with other tumors originating from eccrine glands. Poroid hidradenoma has only recently been recognized, and only a limited number of cases have been reported in the medical literature. In this instance, we present an unusual occurrence of a giant poroid hidradenoma on the left forearm of an elderly patient.

title: A Successful Treatment of COVID-Induced Acute Idiopathic Pancreatitis with an RNA-Polymerase Inhibitor Agent.
abstract: Acute idiopathic pancreatitis (AIP) has been rarely linked to SARS-CoV-2 and its mechanism is not completely understood. As a result, its management, due to the heterogeneity of the literature, may pose a challenge. This case report describes a 59-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with severe epigastric pain, fever, and a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Imaging confirmed acute interstitial pancreatitis, which was successfully managed using the viral RNA polymerase inhibitor, remdesivir. Pancreatitis-associated complications, such as sepsis and shock, are recognized as significant factors contributing to extended hospitalization and increased mortality rates. The management of autoimmune pancreatitis poses a challenge due to the diverse existing literature, resulting in a lack of standardized approaches. Although the impact on inpatient mortality of remdesivir remains uncertain, early administration of RNA polymerase inhibitors could alleviate complications and positively impact the duration of hospitalization. Further research is important to create optimal management strategies for complications related to COVID-19-related pancreatitis.

title: Whipple's Disease: A Challenging Diagnosis.
abstract: Whipple's disease (WD) is a chronic multisystemic infection caused by <i>Tropheryma whipplei</i>. It is a rare condition with a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, necessitating a high clinical suspicion to arrive at the diagnosis. We present the case of a 65-year-old woman who experienced chronic, intermittent, and migratory polyarthralgia, weight loss, anorexia, and pyrosis. She was admitted due to bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She exhibited lymphadenopathy without hepatosplenomegaly, and lymph node biopsy revealed reactive lymphadenitis with intrahistiocytic bacilli that reacted positively to periodic acid-Schiff staining. This led to the suspicion of WD, which was subsequently confirmed through small bowel biopsies. She initiated treatment with ceftriaxone and experienced rapid clinical improvement. WD poses a diagnostic challenge. The signs and symptoms are often nonspecific and can result in misdiagnosis as a rheumatic or neoplastic disease. The presentation with DVT, while unusual, has been reported as a manifestation of WD.

title: Autotransplantation of a Tooth Cryopreserved Over 11 Years Using a Programmed Freezer With a Magnetic Field: A Case Report.
abstract: This case report shows an autotransplantation of the lower right cryopreserved third molar into the extraction socket of the lower right first molar. Due to deep caries of the lower right first molar, the mesial root of this tooth was extracted. The patient asked to keep the distal root of the lower right first molar even if the root can survive only for a short period. So, a fixed partial denture supported by the lower right second premolar and the distal root of the lower right first molar was set. However, it was supposed that the distal root of the lower right first molar as an abutment tooth had a poor prognosis. Therefore, we also extracted the lower right third molar and cryopreserved to prepare autotransplantation if the lower right first molar has to be removed in the future. At first, the extracted third molar was frozen using a programmed freezer with a magnetic field named "Cells Alive System" (CAS) freezer, which was developed for tissue cryopreservation, and then, cryopreserved in the -150°C deep freezer. Eleven years later from the cryopreservation of the third molar, the lower right first molar showed root fracture. So, we extracted the lower right first molar and autotransplanted the cryopreserved third molar. Three years later, the autotransplanted tooth continued to be stable with healthy periodontium. The present case revealed that autotransplantation of a long-term cryopreserved tooth in a CAS freezer is a variable method to replace missing teeth.

title: Isolated Pediculosis Presenting With Hypereosinophilia and Iron Deficiency Anemia: A Case Report and Review of Literature.
abstract: In recent years, there has been growing recognition of the association between lice infestation and iron deficiency anemia (IDA). The head lice, known as<i> Pediculosis humanus capitis,</i> and the body lice, known as <i>Pediculosis humanus corporis</i>, are responsible for causing these infestations. This case report focuses on the clinical findings of a 63-year-old woman who sought medical attention in the emergency department because of severe pruritus and generalized pain. Upon initial physical examination, the patient was found to have a severe lice infestation, and laboratory findings revealed IDA (Hb: 6.8 g/dL, MCV: 70 fL, iron: 21 mcg/dL) and hypereosinophilia (3,500/μL). Treatment involved the administration of Permethrin 1% lotion, Ivermectin, and intravenous iron sucrose supplementation. On the fifth day of presentation, the patient's hemoglobin level improved to 8.6 g/dL, and the eosinophil count decreased to 2,000/μL. Despite extensive investigation of the patient's IDA and hypereosinophilia, no clear etiology of IDA was identified. Consequently, the patient was diagnosed with hypereosinophilia and IDA, secondary to severe chronic pediculosis. This case report aims to raise awareness of the possibility of severe pediculosis as a risk factor for iron deficiency and hypereosinophilia.

title: Effectiveness of Neurorehabilitation in Improving the Functional Recovery and Quality of Life of Patients With Parkinson's Disease: A Case Report.
abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative neurological illness characterized by various motor and non-motor symptoms that can lead to varying degrees of functional impairment. Key neuropathological findings include Lewy bodies containing synuclein and the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, reducing the facilitation of voluntary movements. The disease is marked by bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremors. Here, we present the case of a 56-year-old man who sought neurorehabilitation due to tremors, slowness of movements, and weakness. The rehabilitation plan was carefully devised with weekly goals. The rehabilitation spanned six weeks, during which the individual showed positive improvement in all measured outcomes. Virtual reality and exergame technologies have emerged as prominent tools for enhancing balance and gait in PD. Our study utilized outcome measures such as the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, the World Health Organization Quality-of-Life Scale, and the Barthel Index. Neurophysiotherapy plays a significant role in enhancing a patient's functional rehabilitation.

title: IgG4-Related Kidney Disease: A Diagnostic Conundrum Successfully Treated With Steroids and Rituximab.
abstract: IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is an immune-mediated fibroinflammatory condition that has been recognized as a unified systemic disease that links many individual organ conditions that were previously considered to be unrelated. The pathological hallmark of the disease is an abundant IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltration in the affected tissues and fibrosis. It is a great mimicker of neoplastic, inflammatory, and infectious conditions. We report a 72-year-old man who presented to our hospital with dyspnea and oliguria. Detailed evaluation revealed that he was treated at multiple places for right-sided loin pain over the past 10 months and was found to have right-sided hydronephrosis, renal dysfunction, and multiple enlarged lymph nodes. A search for underlying malignancy previously was unyielding and he had rapid worsening of renal function prior to the current presentation. He was uremic and was initiated on hemodialysis. Kidney biopsy revealed features of IgG4-related tubulointerstitial nephritis. Despite tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis involving more than 50% of the sampled cortex, he showed a good response to steroids and rituximab (RTX) and became dialysis-independent. This report underscores the masquerading presentation of IgG4-RD which can hinder timely diagnosis and demonstrates the usefulness of a regimen of steroids and RTX in its treatment.

abstract: <i>Aeromonas veronii</i>-associated ulcerative colitis flare is sparsely reported in the literature but is a treatable condition with antibiotics including trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), fluoroquinolones, and second/third-generation cephalosporins. We report a case of a patient with long-standing ulcerative colitis (UC), who presented with bloody stools, fatigue, and oliguria that did not respond to standard regimen including steroids. The lab finding was significant for leukocytosis and anemia. <i>A. veronii</i> was cultured in the stool specimens. The patient was started on ciprofloxacin with marked improvement of symptoms on the second day of initiation of the antibiotic. Although rare, a possible Aeromonas infection should be suspected in patients presenting with a flare of ulcerative colitis. A prompt initiation of treatment can provide rapid improvement in clinical status of these patients.

title: Two Cases of Acute Diverticulitis Following Ocrelizumab Infusion in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis.
abstract: Ocrelizumab is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody used to treat primary progressive and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Several prior case reports have demonstrated colitis in association with ocrelizumab infusion, and one case report has shown ocrelizumab-associated diverticulitis. We report on two cases in which ocrelizumab treatment of multiple sclerosis was complicated by acute diverticulitis. A 50-year-old woman and a 41-year-old man, both with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, presented with acute abdominal pain. One patient had no known gastrointestinal history while the other had a history of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Both patients had received an ocrelizumab infusion one month prior to presentation. The woman underwent exploratory laparotomy, which revealed perforated sigmoid diverticulitis. The man was initially suspected of appendicitis and was treated with appendectomy, but a pathology review demonstrated diverticular disease in the appendix. In patients with multiple sclerosis on ocrelizumab, presentation with diverticulitis should include ocrelizumab-induced diverticulitis in the differential diagnosis.

title: Rare Idiopathic Adult Intussusception: A Case Report.
abstract: Intussusception is highly uncommon in adults, with most cases caused by a pathological lead point that requires surgical resection. This case presentation highlights a rare example of idiopathic intussusception in a young male adult. Our patient is a 23-year-old African American male who presented at the Piedmont Macon Medical Center emergency department in February 2023 with acute-onset severe periumbilical pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Computed tomography (CT) imaging was inconclusive, and his diagnosis of an ileo-ileal intussusception in the distal ileum was made during an exploratory (diagnostic) laparoscopy. Based on a visual inspection of the bowel demonstrating no evidence of inflammation, adhesions, lesions, ischemia, or a pathological lead point, manual reduction without resection was indicated. While intussusception is rare in adults, it is an important clinical prognosis that should be carefully considered in the differential diagnosis.

title: Nortriptyline-Induced Room Tilt Illusion.
abstract: Room tilt illusion (RTI) is a rare and transient perceptual disturbance in which an individual perceives their surroundings as having been rotated or tilted, usually at 90 or 180 degrees. Primarily linked with vestibular disorders and neurological lesions, this report details the only reported occurrence of the RTI phenomena in nortriptyline use for treatment-refractory depression. The patient developed RTI six days after starting the medication and the disturbance resolved after medication cessation. Although the mechanism behind such a phenomenon with medication use has not been elucidated, its etiology may rest on the effect of tricyclic antidepressants on the vestibulo-thalamo-cortical system and visual-vestibular integration. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for such a medication-induced perceptual disturbance, especially in the workup for more serious etiologies in elderly patients with co-morbidities.

title: Removal of Six Esophageal Metals in a Four-Month-Old Infant: A Rare Case.
abstract: This case report details the distinctive and demanding clinical situation involving a four-month-old female neonate. Her chief complaint was a two-day refusal to consume food orally, accompanied by episodes of vomiting following feedings and a sensation of choking in the throat. The referring physician suspected the presence of a foreign body in the patient's esophagus and advised a chest X-ray following a thorough examination. The presence of six hyperdense metallic foreign bodies in the upper, mid, and distal dorsal esophagus was confirmed by subsequent CT thorax imaging. This case was managed through the implementation of a multidisciplinary strategy. A decision was reached to conduct an endoscopic assessment; a substantial foreign object resembling a boulder was detected throughout the procedure, resulting in total obstruction of the esophageal lumen. Despite some challenges, this foreign object was effectively extracted by utilizing a Dormia basket. After that, endoscopy was used to detect five more metallic foreign bodies, all successfully eliminated endoscopically. The postoperative course was characterized by the 24-hour prophylactic Ryles tube insertion, followed by the resumption of breastfeeding. The infant's recovery and positive attitude on the second day following the operation indicate the case's successful resolution, emphasizing the criticality of a timely intervention in similar circumstances. This report underscores the clinical management and treatment of multiple metallic foreign bodies in a pediatric patient while also stressing the importance of prompt diagnosis and interprofessional collaboration in complex and exceptional cases.

abstract: Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome (APS) type 3B is characterized by presence of autoimmune thyroid disease, chronic atrophic gastritis and pernicious anemia. In this report, we present a rare case of APS type 3B with neuropathy by thiamine deficiency. A 65-year-old man had a history with hypothyroidism, gastritis, gastrectomy for gastric cancer and subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Patient developed polyneuropathy with not mecobalamin but thiamine deficiency. Serum anti-thyroglobin (TG), anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO), and anti-gastric parietal cell antibodies were positive. He was treated with thiamine supplementation and improved muscle weakness, sensory impairment and gait disturbance. Classically, it is reported gastric cancer related to hypothyroidism. Additionally, thiamine deficiency can be caused by gastrectomy. Here, his thiamine deficiency was related to APS type 3B, leading to polyneuropathy.

abstract: Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a systemic neoplastic process that mostly affects the lymph nodes of the cervical, supraclavicular, and mediastinal regions. The involvement of the central nervous system by HL is rare, and the diagnosis is typically determined based on distinct morphological and immunohistochemical analyses performed on tissue biopsy specimens. Intracranial HL is so scarce that any of the intracranial space-occupying pathology in a patient with established HL must be meticulously investigated to rule out a secondary disease process. Here, we report a unique case of intracranial HL in a 31-year-old African American male who was previously treated with anti-CD30 antibodies.

The authors describe a 12-year-old male with acute infectious mononucleosis, hepatitis, cholestasis, and an autoimmune hemolytic disorder caused by cold agglutinins IgM (anti-i specificity). Clinical deterioration with persistent fever, anemia, and hepatosplenomegaly was consistent with cold AIHA plus concomitant HLH. The patient was treated with corticosteroids and acyclovir, with an uneventful recovery. Although rare, cold agglutinin syndrome and HLH can complicate infectious mononucleosis and should be considered in a patient with clinical deterioration. Corticosteroids are the mainstay treatment of HLH and may be beneficial in infection-associated cold agglutinin syndrome.

title: A Case of Acute Eosinophilic Pneumonia Associated With Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs.
abstract: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used and their gastric, cardiovascular, and renal adverse effects have been well documented. Although rare, NSAID-induced acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) may occur. We report a case of AEP related to naproxen and celecoxib. The patient presented with dry cough and breathlessness two weeks after she started taking these drugs. The chest radiograph displayed bilateral opacities and she had peripheral eosinophilia. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed at a time when blood eosinophilia was already decreasing and cell analysis revealed 63700 cells/mL with 9% eosinophil. After ruling out other possible etiologies, drug-induced AEP was diagnosed. The patient improved after drug discontinuation. When it comes to drug-induced AEP identifying a causative agent is essential as cessation of the drug is the mainstay of the treatment.

title: T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Crisis: Hyperleukocytosis, Tumor Lysis Syndrome, and Innovative Approaches.
abstract: T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a rare hematologic malignancy with a unique set of clinical challenges when it occurs in adults. This case report presents the complex management of a 32-year-old male with T-ALL who developed symptomatic hyperleukocytosis and tumor lysis syndrome. Upon presentation, the patient exhibited a constellation of critical clinical and laboratory findings, including leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyperkalemia, high-anion gap metabolic acidosis, and acute kidney injury. Despite an initial diagnosis of an allergic reaction, the subsequent course of the disease necessitated rapid medical intervention and consultation with multiple specialties, including hematology-oncology and nephrology. The challenges encountered in managing this patient's condition, particularly in an intensive care unit setting, underscored the need for a tailored and multidisciplinary approach. Treatment modalities included leukapheresis, continuous renal replacement therapy, aggressive fluid resuscitation, and chemotherapy. The case highlights the intricate decision-making processes and adaptability required when addressing T-ALL with hyperleukocytosis and tumor lysis syndrome, particularly in cases where conventional chemotherapy is contraindicated. This report underscores the importance of ongoing research and the need for standardized treatment protocols for such complex clinical scenarios.

title: Dorsal Lytic Lesions: Cancer or Infection?
abstract: Infectious spondylodiscitis is a rare disease and typically presents with an insidious progression characterized by spinal pain that usually starts gradually and progressively worsens over several weeks to months. It occurs through three main mechanisms: direct contamination in cases of trauma or surgery, hematogenous dissemination, or through contiguity. We report the case of a 63-year-old male, admitted due to a history of dorsolumbar pain after falling from a height of 1.5 meters, with four months of evolution, without other accompanying symptoms, and refractory to anti-inflammatory and analgesic therapy. Initial laboratory evaluation revealed normocytic and normochromic anemia and a slight elevation in C-reactive protein. Computed tomography of the spine showed pathological fractures of T7-T9. A percutaneous biopsy was performed, positive for methicillin-sensitive <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and the patient underwent 12 weeks of targeted antibiotic therapy. A surgical procedure with percutaneous posterior arthrodesis from T4 to T12 was performed. With this case, the authors aim to emphasize the importance of biopsy as a complementary diagnostic method to imaging studies in the diagnosis of spondylodiscitis, with the possibility of identifying the causative agent.

abstract: Pericardial effusion is a rare manifestation of tuberculosis (TB) that can present as a life-threatening emergency. It poses a diagnostic challenge, as its clinical presentation may mimic other more common causes of acute cardiac emergencies. Emergency physicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for tuberculosis, particularly in regions where the prevalence of the disease is high. This case report is about a 17-year-old girl who presented to the emergency room with dyspnea, chest discomfort, and hemodynamic instability consistent with cardiac tamponade. Urgent diagnostic procedures, including point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) and pericardiocentesis, were crucial to the successful management of this patient.

abstract: Erythema multiforme (EM) is a rare and typically self-limited mucocutaneous reaction known to present secondary to various triggers, with the most common being from an infectious etiology. Medications account for a small percentage of EM cases. Here, we report a case of a 55-year-old female who presented to her primary care physician with a circular rash on the palm of her right hand, which she noticed five days after being started on atorvastatin due to right branch retinal artery occlusion. The rash was identified as case of non-photoinduced EM associated with atorvastatin use presenting solely on the palmar aspect of the patient's hand and resolving four days after discontinuation of the medication. Current literature only describes photoinduced cases of EM secondary to statin use making this case unique, and it provides important insights about considering alternative lipid-lowering treatment options for patients with recurrent or persistent cases.

title: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in a Patient With Systemic Sclerosis: A Case of a Life-Threatening Complication.
abstract: Numerous pulmonary conditions, such as aspiration pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), may result from aspiration of gastric or oropharyngeal contents passing into the lower respiratory tract. ARDS is a type of diffuse lung injury that is distinguished by the abrupt onset of extensive pulmonary inflammation accompanied by the failure of multiple organ systems. Systemic sclerosis is an uncommon connective tissue disorder that presents with skin thickening, the etiology of which remains unknown. Esophageal luminal dilatation is observed in the distal third of the esophagus in most cases of systemic sclerosis. This dilatation is primarily attributed to the greater abundance of smooth muscle fibers in this area. Here, we present the case of a 70-year-old female patient who was diagnosed clinically with diffuse systemic sclerosis and fulfilled the 2013 European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology classification criteria. She had esophageal dilatation, with an esophageal luminal diameter measured at the upper, middle, and lower thoracic esophagus of 2.5 cm, 2.5 cm, and 3.5 cm, respectively. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to ARDS from aspiration pneumonia. Our patient's complicated condition at the time of ICU admission with ARDS secondary to aspiration pneumonia was primarily due to esophageal dilatation and reflux. Aggressive anti-reflux pharmacotherapy and bed elevation may be beneficial in preventing pulmonary injury caused by aspiration. Esophageal complications are common in such patients and can have a substantial impact on the prognosis and quality of life. Regular medical attention is necessary to identify and manage any potential issues.

title: Catheter-Related Right Atrial Endocarditis in a Dialysis Patient.
abstract: Hemodialysis catheters are frequently used for vascular access in end-stage chronic kidney disease patients lacking mature arteriovenous fistula. The incidence of infective endocarditis in hemodialysis patients is higher than in the general population and is associated with severe and potentially life-threatening complications. A high index of suspicion is imperative for early diagnosis and timely intervention to enhance the prognosis of this high-mortality condition. Imaging studies, like transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, are crucial for prompt diagnosis. We present a case of a 36-year-old woman undergoing hemodialysis, whose prolonged use of a permanent catheter led to the development of infective endocarditis complicated with septic pulmonary embolism. Our case report presents an example of right atrial endocarditis with a poor outcome due to delayed diagnosis.

Here, we report two cases of recurrent pemetrexed-induced lower extremity erythema and edema, one in a 60-year-old male and the other in a 47-year-old male, who were both treated for recurrent cellulitis on multiple occasions before finally being diagnosed with pemetrexed-induced pseudocellulitis (PIP), a rarely reported adverse effect. This is an important diagnostic pitfall for clinicians to be aware of, as early recognition may minimize patient morbidity and prevent unnecessary hospitalization and antibiotic use for presumed cellulitis.

title: Comprehensive Rehabilitation of a Patient With Right Hemiplegia: A Case Report.
abstract: Stroke is a common cause of death and neurological impairment. The largest artery in the brain is the middle cerebral artery. When this artery suffers a stroke from an abrupt interruption or cessation of blood flow, tissue dies, and severe, potentially irreversible brain damage occurs. Comprehensive assessments of stroke patients are required for proper care management, evaluation of interventions, and assessment of outcomes. With the development of new, efficient stroke treatments, it is of the utmost significance for nurses to take advantage of the chance to document stroke impairments and disabilities to track recovery and make plans for re-entry into society. We describe the case of a 50-year-old man with right hemiplegia. The brain CT made visible the left front parietotemporal region and the left insular cortex of the acute left-sided middle cerebral artery infarct. The patient received immediate medical attention. After the early stabilization of acute symptoms, physiotherapy treatment was started. The physiotherapy intervention given in this case enabled the patient to have a speedy and effective recovery. It helped improve his motor impairments and quality of life. Post-rehabilitation, the patient became independent in daily activities like brushing, bathing, eating, etc.

title: KIAA1549-BRAF Gene Fusion Spindle Cell Sarcoma With Infantile Fibrosarcoma-Like Pattern in a Pediatric Patient: A Case Report.
abstract: Spindle cell sarcoma with <i>KIAA1549-BRAF</i> fusion is a type of childhood sarcoma that closely resembles infantile fibrosarcoma by morphologic criteria and harbors molecular alteration other than the <i>ETV6-NTRK3</i> fusion gene. This neoplasm was diagnostically challenging without molecular tests, including next-generation sequencing. The discovery of <i>BRAF</i> translocation in this tumor contributes to the promise of the clinical implication of selecting new therapeutic options for the treatment of progressive diseases that are refractory to conventional chemotherapy. Here we present the case of a three-year-old girl who was diagnosed with spindle cell sarcoma with <i>KIAA1549-BRAF</i> fusion gene and had a favorable outcome three years after surgery.

title: When the Lightning Strikes Twice: Navigating the Complex Terrain of Cerebral Tuberculosis.
abstract: Tuberculosis (TB), a <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) infection, remains a significant global health concern despite a declining incidence. This report highlights a complex case involving a 24-year-old patient from Angola who presented with a constellation of symptoms, including fever, weight loss, and neurological deficits. The patient had been on chronic corticosteroid therapy, a known risk factor for the reactivation of latent TB infection (LTBI). Her clinical course was marked by diagnostic challenges, such as a previous diagnosis of Kikuchi's disease and paradoxical progression despite appropriate tuberculostatic chemotherapy. Miliary TB, characterized by widespread dissemination of Mtb from the primary site of infection, can manifest in various extrapulmonary locations. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement, particularly TB meningitis, is the most severe form of TB, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis of miliary and CNS TB can be elusive due to nonspecific clinical presentations and imaging findings. This case underscores the importance of a high index of suspicion, especially in immunocompromised individuals, and the need for comprehensive microbiological analysis, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, to confirm CNS involvement. Furthermore, this case illustrates the challenges associated with TB treatment, including the risk of drug toxicity, medication adherence, and the potential for drug resistance. Treatment duration for miliary TB is extended, typically lasting nine months to a year, and may require adaptation based on the patient's clinical response and drug penetration into the CNS. Corticosteroids play a critical role as adjuvant therapy, particularly in cases with perilesional edema or paradoxical reactions during treatment. This case underscores the complexity of diagnosing and managing miliary and CNS TB, emphasizing the importance of considering TB as a diagnostic possibility in patients with nonspecific symptoms and risk factors. Early identification, multidisciplinary collaboration, and tailored therapeutic strategies are essential for achieving optimal outcomes in such challenging cases. Additionally, screening for latent TB infection should be a priority for patients requiring immunosuppressive therapy to mitigate the risk of reactivation.

title: Iliacus Myositis and Bacteremia Caused by Non-typhoidal Salmonella in a Healthy Adult: A Case Report.
abstract: Typically, non-typhoidal <i>Salmonella</i> (NTS) causes gastroenteritis; however, NTS can also lead to extraintestinal manifestations like bacteremia, meningitis, and abscess in vulnerable populations such as children, elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Extraintestinal manifestations in an immunocompetent patient are uncommon. Here, we report a case of iliacus myositis and bacteremia caused by NTS in a healthy adult. A previously healthy 23-year-old Japanese woman presented to the emergency room due to a one-day history of vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. She had a fever, and her blood test showed leukocytosis. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a thickening of the ascending colon. She was diagnosed with gastroenteritis and treated with antibiotics. Blood culture at that time was negative, but <i>Salmonella</i> serogroup 09 was detected in stool culture. Subsequently, her symptoms improved; however, on day 13, she returned to our hospital complaining of pain in her left thigh. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no abscess or muscle inflammation, but due to persistent symptoms, the patient was admitted to the hospital, and antibiotics were initiated. <i>Salmonella</i> serogroup 09 was detected from the blood culture obtained at the time of admission. Magnetic resonance imaging of the hip joint and CT of the abdomen and pelvis after admission revealed inflammation in the left iliacus muscle and an abscess near the left ilium. The patient was treated successfully with antibiotics. This case highlights two findings. First, NTS can cause bacteremia even in a healthy adult with no risk factors for bacteremia. Second, NTS bacteremia can cause complications in an immunocompetent adult. This case implies that even in the case of NTS infection in otherwise healthy individuals, if there are signs of bacteremia or complications, it is essential to conduct blood culture and additional tests.

abstract: Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis Type 2 (HOKPP2) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of muscle weakness, paralysis, and hypokalemia. In this case report, we present the clinical details of a 49-year-old female diagnosed with HOKPP2. Genetic testing revealed a heterozygous mutation in the Sodium Voltage-Gated Channel Alpha Subunit 4 (<i>SCN4A)</i> gene, confirming the diagnosis of HOKPP2. Management strategies, including potassium supplementation and lifestyle modifications, were implemented, resulting in a significant decrease in the frequency of symptomatic episodes. This case highlights the importance of considering HOKPP2 in patients with recurrent muscle weakness, particularly those with a familial history of similar symptoms. Furthermore, it underscores the crucial role of genetic testing in guiding patient management and facilitating genetic counseling.

title: Endoscopic-Assisted Curettage of Posterior Proximal Tibia Chondroblastoma: A Case Report and Review of Literature.
abstract: Chondroblastoma is a benign cartilage-producing bone lesion that characteristically occurs in the epiphyseal region of long bones. The most typical locations are the proximal humerus, proximal femur, distal femur, and proximal tibia. There is no medical treatment for the disease; classically, it must be treated by intralesional curettage and bone grafting. A 15-year-old female patient presented with chronic knee pain with no antecedent history of trauma. Clinical examination showed deep tenderness on maximum flexion and 15 degrees extension lag with full knee flexion. Plain radiographs and knee MRI showed a lesion in the posterior part of the proximal tibia on the midline, highly suggestive of chondroblastoma. CAT-guided biopsy did not show any evidence of malignancy. Intralesional curettage assisted by endoscopic visualization was done using a small incision, and a bone graft substitute reconstructed the defect. Endoscopic-assisted curettage of benign bone lesions can be considered in challenging locations with good results.

title: Euglycemic Diabetic Ketoacidosis Induced by Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitor Use and Coronary Angiography: A Case Report.
abstract: Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA) is an uncommon subtype of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) which presents with similar laboratory findings to classic DKA with the exception of blood glucose levels being under 250 mg/dl. EDKA has several etiologies including pregnancy, starvation and the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2). SGLT-2 inhibitors such as empagliflozin and dapagliflozin are increasing in popularity due to their positive benefits for patients with diabetes mellitus and cardiac disease. EDKA is underdiagnosed as it presents with blood sugar levels lower than expected in classic DKA. This case report describes a well-controlled type 2 diabetic patient prescribed an SGLT-2 inhibitor who developed EDKA after undergoing coronary angiography for acute heart failure.

title: Critical Case of a Preterm Infant Infected With Respiratory Syncytial Virus Managed in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit: A Case Report.
abstract: We describe a critical case of a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in a preterm infant resulting in respiratory failure with advanced respiratory interventions and discharge from our hospital without the requirement for home oxygen therapy or tube feeding. The infant, delivered at 35 weeks gestation due to a premature rupture of the membranes with a birth weight of 2 kg, initially demonstrated a stable postnatal course. The baby required no resuscitation, with Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at one and five minutes, respectively. The infant was discharged in good condition after four days of hospitalization. This report presents a critical case of RSV infection in a preterm infant requiring intensive care. The infant, born at 35 weeks gestation, initially appeared healthy but developed severe symptoms at 22 days old. The emergency evaluation revealed significant respiratory distress and confirmed RSV pneumonia. Following extensive interventions, including mechanical ventilation to manage severe symptoms, along with complications such as pneumothorax and a cardiac arrest episode, the infant exhibited a positive response to subsequent treatments. The infant responded positively to high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and inhaled nitric oxide. Gradual weaning from advanced ventilation led to successful extubation, followed by recovery with high-flow nasal cannula therapy. The case highlights the challenges of managing severe RSV infections in preterm infants and the efficacy of intensive care interventions in facilitating the infant's remarkable recovery and discharge.

abstract: Mpox (monkeypox) is a zoonotic disease that has been endemic in African countries for decades, with a recent global outbreak in countries around the world. A 39-year-old male with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfection and poor adherence to antiretroviral treatment, who was severely immunocompromised and had a concurrent diagnosis of Mpox, presented to our hospital with disseminated skin lesions (over 350 lesions), perianal ulcers, odynophagia, oral intolerance, diarrhea, and soft-tissue bacterial superinfection of the lower extremities. Laboratory results were consistent with HBV infection, with an absolute CD4 cell count of 40 cells/uL and a positive PCR result for monkeypox virus. An abdominopelvic CT scan showed evidence of severe proctitis and perineal soft-tissue infection. Sixty-five days after a positive monkeypox virus PCR, new lesions in the vesicular stage continued to appear, eventually developing hemodynamic instability and sepsis, resulting in a fatal outcome. Our case highlights the importance of intentionally looking for risk factors such as HIV/HBV coinfection and evaluating immune status (CD4 cell count) in patients with severe Mpox because it could be related to higher mortality.

title: Anatomical Variant of the Lateral Circumflex Femoral Artery: A Cadaveric Case Report.
abstract: The lateral circumflex femoral artery (LCFA), a branch of the deep femoral artery (DFA), supplies the muscular and fascial anatomy of the anterior thigh. An undocumented variation of the LCFA was discovered during a dissection of the lower extremities. The LCFA is a vital vessel that can be used in coronary artery bypass grafts (CABGs) and reconstructive and bypass surgical procedures. On the other hand, the LCFA is susceptible to iatrogenic damage during surgeries involving the hip joint and procedures such as femoral nerve blocks. Knowledge of variations in the origin and course of the LFCA, like many other anatomical structures, is an important concept that physicians and health care providers must be aware of when performing anterior thigh procedures. This case report shows an interesting duplication of the LCFA, the first originating superiorly from the common femoral artery (CFA) and the second from the deep femoral artery (DFA) inferiorly. Both LCFAs exhibited typical trifurcation into ascending, descending, and transverse branches.

abstract: A 70-year-old Japanese woman with hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus complained of abdominal discomfort and vomiting and was brought to our emergency department by ambulance two days later with impaired consciousness. Her vital signs suggested shock with a heart rate of 120 bpm. Electrocardiogram and initial transthoracic echocardiography suggested an inferior wall ST-elevation myocardial infarction, but the altered consciousness was inconsistent. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography was urgently performed to further clarify the cause. It revealed pericardial effusion and apparent extravasation from the left ventricular wall, confirming the early definitive diagnosis of left ventricular free wall rupture. The patient underwent successful emergent surgical repair without sequelae. Differential diagnosis of left ventricular free wall rupture is important in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction and impaired consciousness. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography allows early diagnosis and treatment of this life-threatening complication.

title: Rheumatoid Arthritis Patient With Neurofibromatosis Type 1: Case Report and Review of the Literature.
abstract: A 66-year-old neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patient with polyarticular pain for nine years, aggravated for two days, was transferred from the Emergency Intensive Care Unit (EICU) to our rheumatology department. She was diagnosed with NF1 nine years ago by a gene mutation detection and coronary heart disease (CHD) three months ago. The patient was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) this time. After 24 days of treatment with appropriate medication, the patient was discharged with relieved joint pain. However, about four months later, the patient died of circulatory failure caused by myocardial infarction. We analyzed the possible reasons for her outcome and made a review of the literature. There are few clinical reports of NF1 complicated with RA. We found five cases reported in the literature up to date during our search and included them in our communication to compare with our case. NF1 combined with RA mainly affects adult women and usually starts with NF1 and is followed by RA after at least six years of NF1 symptom onset. Although the summarized characteristics of clinical and potential pathogenesis of NF1 combined with RA were limited with these six cases, we hope that this will help clinicians to increase their understanding of this rare complication, thus helping to guide clinical medication.

title: Atypical Mycobacterial Infection Mimicking Psoriasis in an Elderly Patient: Diagnostic Challenges and Management.
abstract: Atypical mycobacterial infections can have diverse clinical presentations, frequently resulting in diagnostic challenges. This study examines an uncommon atypical mycobacterial disease in an older patient, initially misidentified as psoriasis, emphasizing the difficulties in diagnosing and managing the condition. A 70-year-old male patient arrived at the dermatology department at National Hospital and Medical Centre, Lahore, with a persistent, dry, red rash mainly affecting his arms and legs. The patient had a medical background of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Initial clinical diagnosis suggested psoriasis based on the appearance and patient's age. The patient was started on conventional psoriatic therapies. However, there was only a slight improvement, which led to the need for additional inquiry. Skin biopsies were conducted, uncovering the presence of granulomatous inflammation. Following cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, the presence of atypical mycobacteria was established. Subsequent laboratory tests eliminated the possibility of tuberculosis (TB) and other prevalent diseases. The conclusive diagnosis was an unusual mycobacterial infection, which posed a challenge due to its clinical similarity to psoriasis. The patient was treated with antibiotics appropriate to the mycobacterial species discovered. The duration of the treatment spanned six months, resulting in a notable amelioration of the skin lesions. The patient is being closely observed for any potential reoccurrence. This case highlights the significance of including atypical mycobacterial infection as a possible diagnosis for persistent dermatological problems, particularly in persons with impaired immune systems. It emphasizes the need for biopsy and culture in unusual situations of suspected psoriasis. This instance also demonstrates the intricacies associated with managing older patients with multiple concurrent medical issues. Unusual mycobacterial infections can imitate conventional skin disorders such as psoriasis, presenting considerable difficulties in diagnosis. Having a strong suspicion and doing relevant laboratory tests are essential for achieving an accurate diagnosis and efficient treatment.

title: Emergency Surgical Treatment of a Large Pedunculated Subserosal Uterine Leiomyoma With Torsion: A Rare Cause of Acute Abdomen.
abstract: Torsion of pedunculated subserosal leiomyoma of the uterus is a rare cause of acute abdomen. A 27-year-old female patient with twisted subserosal pedunculated uterine leiomyoma misdiagnosed as an adnexal mass underwent laparotomy. The patient came to the Emergency Department of General Hospital of Trikala with symptoms of acute abdomen. Primarily, clinical-laboratory examination, transabdominal ultrasound, raised the suspicion of a twisted adnexal mass. Intraoperatively, a twisted pedunculated subserosal leiomyoma of the uterus was identified and myomectomy was performed. Histological examination of the surgical specimen confirmed the diagnosis. On the third postoperative day, our patient was discharged. This paper underscores the rarity of torsion of the uterine pedunculated subserosal leiomyoma and emphasizes the necessity of urgent surgical intervention. The challenges of preoperative diagnosis are highlighted, especially when modern diagnostic imaging modalities are unavailable.

title: Oromandibular Dystonia After Low-Dose Olanzapine Treatment in a Patient With Marchiafava-Bignami Disease With Demyelinating Lesions in the Corpus Callosum: A Case Report.
abstract: Marchiafava-Bignami disease is a rare disorder characterized by demyelination and necrosis of the central nervous system. Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions. Herein, we present the case of a patient with Marchiafava-Bignami disease who developed acute oromandibular dystonia after receiving a very low dose of olanzapine. He was a 60-year-old Japanese man who was diagnosed with demyelinating lesions in the corpus callosum associated with Marchiafava-Bignami disease. At one point, he became agitated at night and was administered olanzapine 2.5 mg, resulting in the onset of oromandibular dystonia; however, the symptoms disappeared upon discontinuation of the drug. Primary dystonia is believed to arise solely from abnormal basal ganglia function in the absence of apparent morphological changes, according to the traditional view. However, recent studies suggest the involvement of lesions beyond the basal ganglia and organic factors, including ultrastructural changes. Rare side effects that develop following small doses of olanzapine indicate that demyelinating lesions of the corpus callosum may be partially responsible for oromandibular dystonia. This case report supports previous reports that the corpus callosum is involved in dystonia and provides insights into the pathophysiology underlying oromandibular dystonia.

title: The Effect of Double Carbapenem Regimen in the Management of Carbapenem-Resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae Infections: A Report of Five Cases.
abstract: The treatment of infections caused by carbapenem-resistant organisms is challenging. Carbapenems in combination with vaborbactam and relebactam are recommended to treat infections caused by extensively drug-resistant organisms including carbapenemase-producing isolates, while ceftazidime-avibactam plus aztreonam, or cefiderocol is recommended for infections caused by New Delhi metallo beta-lactamase (NDM)-producing <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>. As, in India, except for ceftazidime-avibactam and aztreonam, the other drugs are not approved for marketing, in this case report, the role of a double carbapenem regimen (ertapenem plus meropenem) in the treatment of carbapenem-resistant <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> infections has been presented. In one case, the in vitro effect of the double carbapenem regimen on pan drug-resistant (PDR) <i>K. pneumoniae</i> isolates from a blood culture specimen of a critically ill patient using a time-kill study is presented. In this case, only a double carbapenem regimen with 2 MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) meropenem + 2 MIC ertapenem demonstrated bactericidal activity by inhibition of bacterial growth of PDR <i>K. pneumoniae</i> isolate, at four and eight hours, which was sustained till 24 hours. However, while 2 MIC meropenem + 2 MIC colistin inhibited bacterial growth at four hours and eight hours, bacterial regrowth occurred by 24 hours. In addition, four cases of critically ill patients with infections caused by carbapenem-resistant <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> are presented in whom a double carbapenem regimen was recommended for treatment. Of these four cases, a complete clinical cure was observed in three cases, and a microbiological cure in the fourth case. As the double carbapenem regimen demonstrated effect in an in vitro time-kill study in the first case and on clinical outcomes in three out of the latter four cases, it appears to be a life-saving, salvage therapy in infections caused by carbapenem-resistant <i>K. pneumoniae</i> in India.

title: Non-perforated Traumatic Pneumoperitoneum in Maxillofacial Trauma: A Compelling Case Report.
abstract: Pneumoperitoneum typically results from intraabdominal gas due to gastrointestinal perforation, with exploratory laparotomy serving as the standard management. While non-surgical causes are well established, instances where pneumoperitoneum lacks an identifiable cause even after laparotomy are sparsely documented. Here, we present a case involving a 22-year-old male who, following a high-velocity road traffic injury resulting in a panfacial fracture, exhibited gross subcutaneous emphysema in the neck, pneumomediastinum, and pneumoperitoneum. This report aims to contribute to the growing understanding of such cases, potentially leading to the development of a management protocol that may help avoid unnecessary laparotomies in similar scenarios.

title: An Extremely Rare and Aggressive Case of Undifferentiated Carcinoma With Osteoclast-Like Giant Cells of the Pancreas Presenting as a Paraneoplastic Syndrome: A Case Report and Literature Review.
abstract: Undifferentiated carcinoma with osteoclast-like giant cells (UC-OGC) is a rare tumor type of pancreatic cancer. Paraneoplastic syndromes, an idiopathic inflammatory myositis characterized by various skin manifestations (such as dermatomyositis (DM)), cannot be attributed to the primary tumor itself. Here, we report an unusual case of UC-OGC presenting as a paraneoplastic syndrome, the first reported from Saudi Arabia and the Arabian Gulf states. A 49-year-old Eritrean woman with known DM was referred to our hospital with a left-sided pleural effusion. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a large necrotic splenic mass (~17 × 12.9 × 18.2 cm). The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy with en bloc resection of the mass (splenectomy, distal pancreatectomy, and partial excision of the left hemidiaphragm). Following a histopathological examination of the mass, UG-OGC of the pancreas, presenting as a paraneoplastic syndrome, was diagnosed. To our knowledge, this case is the first to present a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with UC-OGC. The identification of an exceedingly rare tumor presenting atypically as a paraneoplastic syndrome shows the importance of conducting comprehensive examinations of patients with malignancies, emphasizing the need for more reports of similar cases.

title: A Case Report of Recurrent Acute Laryngeal Dystonia With Different Novel Antipsychotics: Aripiprazole and Olanzapine.
abstract: Acute laryngeal dystonia (ALD) is a rare side effect of antipsychotic medications, but it is a life-threatening condition. We are introducing the case of a 49-year-old Saudi single male, who has been known to have schizophrenia for the last 20 years. He developed three attacks of acute laryngeal dystonia owing to different antipsychotic medications. The first was because of haloperidol on a dose of 20 mg a day. After being treated for dystonia and stabilized physically, the patient received oral aripiprazole at a dose of 10 mg a day. Unfortunately, he developed acute laryngeal dystonia, and treatment had to be discontinued. The third attack of dystonia was two months later because of the use of olanzapine in a dose of only 5 mg/day. The patient was finally stabilized on quetiapine with no more side effects. This case highlights the importance of careful monitoring of patients who are receiving antipsychotic medications, even newer ones, to avoid, or treat, such a rare but serious side effect early.

title: Pityriasis Rosea With Multiple Herald Patches Resulting in a V-shaped Pattern and a Christmas Tree Distribution.
abstract: Pityriasis rosea (PR), a benign and self-limiting skin disorder, typically manifests as a single initial lesion known as the herald patch. The herald patch is commonly followed by the development of secondary erythematous papules and plaques, aligning with Langer's lines to form a specific distribution pattern, resembling a Christmas tree on the back and a V-shaped pattern on the upper chest. Therefore, diagnosing PR may not be difficult based on its typical clinical presentation. In contrast, cases of atypical PR presentation have been reported, encompassing several differential diagnoses. Here, we present a case with multiple herald patches that needed differentiation from ringworm, syphilis, and erythema annular centrifugum. Subsequently, our case was diagnosed with PR, as the patches formed a V-shaped pattern and a Christmas-tree distribution.

title: Giant Coronary Artery Aneurysm Due to Implantation of Drug-Eluting Stent.
abstract: Development of coronary artery aneurysm after implantation of a drug-eluting stent is a rare complication. The mechanism behind aneurysm formation is unknown, but studies suggest hypersensitivity and inflammatory reactions elicited by the stent polymer. Here, we report a case of a 57-year-old man who was treated with a sirolimus-eluting Cypher<sup>TM</sup> stent in the left anterior descending artery due to stable angina pectoris and left circumflex artery due to dissection. Coronary aneurysm formation at the site of stent implantation was discovered three years after the stents were deployed, and progression of the aneurysms was seen in the coronary artery angiography. We hypothesize about the mechanism of aneurysm formation and present management of the aneurysms.
